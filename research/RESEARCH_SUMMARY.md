## Critical Finding: Calibration Over Accuracy

### THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

**Research Paper**: "Machine learning for sports betting: Should model selection be based on accuracy or calibration?" (2024)

**Key Result**:
- **Model selection based on CALIBRATION**: ROI of **+34.69%**
- **Model selection based on ACCURACY**: ROI of **-35.17%**

**Conclusion**: For sports betting applications, **calibration is 70% more important than accuracy**.

### What This Means for Your Model

```python
# WRONG APPROACH
best_model = max(models, key=lambda m: m.accuracy_score)  # DON'T DO THIS

# CORRECT APPROACH
best_model = min(models, key=lambda m: m.brier_score)     # DO THIS
```

**Primary Metrics**:
1. **Brier Score** (lower is better, target < 0.20)
2. **Log Loss** (lower is better)
3. **Calibration Curves** (should follow diagonal)

**Secondary Metrics**:
4. **Closing Line Value (CLV)** - beat closing line by 1-2%
5. **Expected Value (EV)** - consistent positive EV
6. **ROI** - after 500+ bets minimum

## Top 10 Highest-Impact Features (Research-Validated)

### 1. Opponent Defense vs. Position
**Impact**: Creates edge opportunities
- Opponent defensive rating by position (Guard/Forward/Center)
- Points allowed per 100 possessions to position
- **Why**: Markets slow to adjust for matchup effects, especially for non-stars

### 2. Rest & Schedule Features
**Impact**: Massive performance differences
- **+1 day rest**: 37.6% increase in win likelihood
- **Each rest day**: 15.96% decrease in injury odds
- Back-to-back penalty: significant performance decline
- **Implementation**: Days rest, B2B indicator, games in last 7 days

### 3. Lag Features (1, 3, 5, 7, 10 Games)
**Impact**: Proven effective in multiple studies
- Research tested 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 game lags
- Best performance with previous 20-30 games
- **Implementation**: Create lags for PRA, points, rebounds, assists, minutes

### 4. Projected Minutes
**Impact**: "Most critical opportunity stat" per research
- Separate minutes prediction model essential
- Four rotation change drivers: injuries, role changes, matchups, blowouts
- **Implementation**: Minutes model + volatility tracking

### 5. Rolling Averages (Multiple Windows)
**Impact**: Balances recent form with stability
- Research recommends 5, 10, 20, 30-game windows
- Multiple horizons capture different patterns
- **Implementation**: SMA for all key stats

### 6. EWMA (Exponential Weighted Moving Average)
**Impact**: Handles recency bias properly
- More sophisticated than simple last-N games
- NBA Math uses 10-game rolling for players, 20-game for teams
- **Implementation**: Test alpha values [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

### 7. Pace Normalization
**Impact**: Fundamental for cross-team comparisons
- Per-100-possession standardization
- Team pace * opponent pace interactions
- **Implementation**: `adjusted_stat = raw_stat * (league_pace / team_pace)`

### 8. Usage Rate
**Impact**: Core opportunity metric
- Multiple studies identify as key predictor
- Especially important when teammates are out
- **Implementation**: Current + historical + context-dependent usage

### 9. Home/Away Splits
**Impact**: Player-specific edge opportunities
- Some players have large home/away performance differences
- Examples: Nikola Jokic (assists/rebounds lower on road), Klay Thompson (well-known splits)
- **Implementation**: Last 10-game home/away averages + differentials

### 10. Volatility & Consistency Metrics
**Impact**: Risk assessment and prop line targeting
- Coefficient of variation
- Floor (25th percentile) and Ceiling (75th percentile)
- **Implementation**: Rolling standard deviations, min/max tracking

## Model Architecture: XGBoost Dominates

### Research Consensus

**Best Performing Models**:
1. **XGBoost**: Outperformed all other algorithms across multiple studies
2. **LightGBM**: Closest performance to XGBoost, faster training
3. **Random Forest**: Solid baseline (67-74% accuracy)
4. **Tree-Based Models**: Extra Trees (34.14% WAPE), RF (34.23% WAPE), DT (34.41% WAPE)

**Academic Validation**:
- 2024 study benchmarked 14 ML models - XGBoost performed best
- XGBoost + SHAP for interpretability widely used
- Ensemble methods combining XGBoost + LightGBM show promise

**Your Current Plan**: XGBoost primary, LightGBM secondary - **PERFECT CHOICE**

---

## Validation Strategy: Time-Based Only

### The Non-Negotiable Rule

**NEVER**:
```python
# This will destroy your model
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)  # WRONG
```

**ALWAYS**:
```python
# Walk-Forward Validation
train_window = 1000  # games
test_window = 200    # games
step_size = 200      # roll forward

for i in range(0, len(data) - train_window - test_window, step_size):
    train = data[i:i+train_window]
    test = data[i+training_window:i+training_window+test_window]
    # Train and evaluate
```

**Research Finding**: "Combinatorial Purged CV (CPCV) shows marked superiority in mitigating overfitting risks" but Walk-Forward is industry standard.

**Key Principle**: Training set ONLY includes observations PRIOR to test set. No future data leakage.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Overfitting (BIGGEST RISK)
**Symptoms**:
- Large gap between in-sample and out-of-sample performance
- Too many features or hyperparameter iterations
- "Memorizing instead of learning"

**Solutions**:
- Limit tuning iterations
- Use L1/L2 regularization
- Test across multiple seasons
- Nested cross-validation for hyperparameters

### 2. Sample Size Mistakes
**Guidelines**:
- **Player stats**: ~400 minutes playing time (~10-13 games) for significance
- **Model evaluation**: 500+ predictions minimum before conclusions
- **Early season**: Higher volatility, wider confidence intervals

### 3. Recency Bias
**Problem**: Overweighting last 1-2 games
**Solution**: Use EWMA, balance recent with larger samples

### 4. Look-Ahead Bias
**Problem**: Using data not available at prediction time
**Solution**: Timestamp all data, recreate exact conditions

### 5. Ignoring Calibration
**Problem**: Optimizing for accuracy instead of calibration
**Solution**: Primary metric = Brier Score, not hit rate

## Key Research Statistics

### Rest & Fatigue Effects
- **+37.6%** win likelihood with 1+ day rest
- **-15.96%** injury odds per rest day
- **+2.87%** injury odds per 96 minutes played
- **+8.23%** injury odds per 3 additional rebounds
- **+9.87%** injury odds per 3 additional field goal attempts

### Model Performance Benchmarks
- NBA upset rate: **28-32%** (better team wins 68-72%)
- Published models: **66-72%** accuracy on games
- Target for edge: **>70%** accuracy, **>55%** hit rate on props at -110

### Home Court Advantage
- **Declining trend** - less impact over time
- Worth "a few points" in spreads
- Player-specific splits more valuable than generic advantage

### Load Management Controversy
- NBA's 2018-2019 study: **NO clear link** between rest and decreased injury risk
- After controlling for age, injury history, minutes: **no association**
- However, fatigue still affects **performance** even if not injury risk

## Bankroll Management: Kelly Criterion

### Implementation

```python
def fractional_kelly(prob_win, odds_decimal, bankroll, fraction=0.25):
    """
    fraction: 0.25-0.5 recommended (quarter to half Kelly)
    """
    edge = (prob_win * odds_decimal) - 1
    kelly_pct = edge / (odds_decimal - 1)
    bet_pct = min(kelly_pct * fraction, 0.05)  # Cap at 5%
    return bankroll * bet_pct if bet_pct > 0 else 0
```

**Research Recommendations**:
- Professional bettors use **25-50% of Kelly**
- Never bet more than **2.5-5%** of bankroll per wager
- Full Kelly too aggressive (high variance)

**Example**:
- 60% win probability at +100 odds = 20% ROI
- Higher Kelly stake for better edges

## Key Quotes from Research

> "For sports betting, calibration is more important than accuracy. Using calibration rather than accuracy as the basis for model selection leads to greater returns on average (ROI of +34.69% versus -35.17%)."

> "The odds of injury increased by 2.87% for each 96 minutes played and decreased by 15.96% for each day of rest."

> "Having at least 1 day of rest between games increased the likelihood of winning by 37.6%."

> "Statistics that rate certain lineups or player combinations are widely cited but notoriously unreliable."

> "The market is often slow to adjust for non-star players, and finding the gap between market pricing and context-rich projections creates an edge."

> "Closing Line Value (CLV) is a favorite among sharp bettors. Beating the closing line by even 1-2% signals a well-calibrated model."

> "The NBA traditionally has an upset rate of 28-32%, meaning the better team wins 68-72% of the time, making it challenging to create models with accuracy higher than this range."
