## What Was Delivered

### 1. Comprehensive Standards Document
**File**: `PRODUCTION_CODE_STANDARDS.md` (9,600 words)

**Contents**:
- Code organization strategy (refactor incrementally, not all at once)
- Testing strategy (60-70% coverage on critical paths)
- Code quality standards (gradual type hint adoption)
- Error handling patterns (fail fast on critical errors)
- Documentation requirements (feature registry, runbooks)
- Performance guidelines (acceptable build times)
- Production readiness checklist (what must be done before live betting)

**Key Philosophy**: Balance speed with quality. High standards where it matters (temporal leakage, betting logic), pragmatic elsewhere.

### 2. Code Review Checklist
**File**: `CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`

**Contents**:
- Critical issues checklist (temporal leakage, data quality, betting logic)
- Important issues (error handling, testing, configuration)
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Domain-specific checks (features, models, pipelines)
- Self-review workflow (for solo developer)
- Peer review workflow (for 2-person team)

**Usage**: Use before every merge to main. Estimated 10-60 minutes depending on change size.

### 3. Pre-Commit Hooks
**File**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Configured Tools**:
- Black (code formatting, 100 char lines)
- Flake8 (linting, relaxed rules)
- Isort (import sorting)
- Pytest quick check (unit tests only)

**Result**: Code quality checks run automatically on every commit.

### 4. Pytest Configuration
**File**: `pytest.ini`

**Settings**:
- Minimum 60% test coverage requirement
- HTML coverage reports
- Test markers (critical, slow, integration, etc.)
- Coverage excludes experiments and notebooks

**Result**: Professional test configuration with coverage tracking.

### 5. Example Test Files

**File**: `tests/unit/test_temporal_leakage.py`
- 10 comprehensive tests for temporal leakage prevention
- Tests for lag features, rolling averages, EWMA
- Tests for train/test splits
- Tests for cross-player leakage
- ALL marked as critical (must pass before production)

**File**: `tests/unit/test_edge_calculator.py`
- 25+ tests for betting logic
- Edge calculation tests
- Kelly Criterion sizing tests
- Risk management tests
- Odds conversion tests
- ALL marked as critical

**Result**: Template for writing thorough, production-grade tests.

### 6. Feature Registry Template
**File**: `docs/FEATURE_REGISTRY_TEMPLATE.md`

**Contents**:
- Template for documenting features
- Two complete examples (CTG_USG, PRA_L5_mean)
- Best practices for feature engineering
- Feature review process
- Maintenance schedule

**Usage**: Document every feature before adding to production model.

### 7. Updated Configuration
**File**: `pyproject.toml` (updated)

**Added**:
- Dev dependencies (pytest, black, flake8, isort, mypy, pre-commit)
- Black configuration (100 char lines, exclude experiments)
- Isort configuration (black-compatible)
- Mypy configuration (strict mode for betting/ and evaluation/)

**Result**: One-command setup: `uv sync --dev`

### 8. Setup Guide
**File**: `SETUP_PRODUCTION_STANDARDS.md`

**Contents**:
- Step-by-step installation (15-20 minutes)
- Verification steps
- Common issues and solutions
- Daily workflow guide
- Quick command reference

**Result**: New developers can get set up in under 30 minutes.

## Key Decisions Made

### Code Organization

**Decision**: Refactor incrementally, not all at once.

**Approach**:
- **Week 1-2**: Keep current structure, add tests
- **Week 3-4**: Consolidate feature engineering into src/features/
- **Week 5-6**: Build production pipelines

**Rationale**: Can't spend 4 weeks refactoring. Need to ship. Refactor while adding features.

### Testing Coverage

**Decision**: 60-70% coverage on critical paths, not 100% everywhere.

**Priority Tiers**:
1. **MUST TEST (Tier 1)**: Temporal leakage, data quality, betting logic, edge calculation
2. **SHOULD TEST (Tier 2)**: Model logic, feature pipeline, data loading
3. **NICE TO TEST (Tier 3)**: Utilities, formatting, logging

**Rationale**: Perfect is the enemy of good. Focus on what can lose us money.

### Type Hints

**Decision**: Gradual adoption, strict on critical modules only.

**Approach**:
- **Phase 1 (Week 1-3)**: Type hints on all new functions
- **Phase 2 (Week 4-6)**: Add types to betting/ and evaluation/
- **Phase 3 (Week 7+)**: Fill in remaining gaps

**Strict Typing**: Only for src/betting/ and src/evaluation/ (money at risk)

**Rationale**: Type hints are valuable but can slow down rapid development. Be strategic.

### Error Handling

**Decision**: Fail fast on critical errors, degrade gracefully otherwise.

**Critical Errors** (raise immediately):
- Temporal leakage detected
- Invalid betting parameters
- Duplicate player-game combinations

**Warnings** (log and continue):
- Missing optional data (CTG stats)
- Low confidence predictions

**Rationale**: For betting, silent failures = lost money. Be loud about problems.

### Documentation

**Decision**: Document features and betting logic thoroughly, everything else pragmatically.

**MUST Document**:
- Feature registry (formulas, leakage risk, correlations)
- Model architecture and decisions
- Betting logic and Kelly sizing
- Production runbook

**NICE TO Document**:
- EDA and experiments
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Code examples

**Rationale**: Features and betting are the core IP. Document these well.

### Performance

**Decision**: Don't optimize until build time > 5 minutes.

**Acceptable Performance**:
- Complete dataset build: < 5 minutes
- Model training: < 10 minutes
- Walk-forward validation: < 60 minutes

**Optimization Strategy**: Profile first, optimize top 20% of bottlenecks.

**Rationale**: Premature optimization wastes time. Get it working first.

## Testing Strategy at a Glance

### Critical Tests (Must Pass Before Production)

1. **Temporal Leakage** (`test_temporal_leakage.py`)
   - Lag features exclude current game
   - Rolling averages use shift(1)
   - No cross-player leakage
   - Train/test splits are chronological

2. **Edge Calculator** (`test_edge_calculator.py`)
   - Edge calculation correct
   - Kelly sizing produces reasonable bets
   - Risk management enforced
   - Odds conversion accurate

3. **Data Quality** (need to create)
   - No duplicates
   - No missing values
   - Proper data types
   - Correct date ranges

4. **Feature Correctness** (need to create)
   - CTG features load correctly
   - Feature formulas are correct
   - Missing data handled properly
   - Correlations match expectations

5. **Walk-Forward Validation** (need to create)
   - No temporal leakage in validation
   - Proper train/test splits
   - Results match expectations
   - Performance tracked

### Test Coverage Targets
