If you are starting to build out features to predict **Points + Rebounds + Assists (PRA)**, you are making a strategic choice, as these **combo props are considered an excellent entry point** for a new modelling effort. By combining three major statistical categories, the **variance of the total is reduced**, making the outcome more stable and often more predictable than its individual components. This smoothing effect makes PRA a robust target for a predictive model.

To effectively predict PRA, you need a multi-layered approach to feature engineering, incorporating a player's core abilities, the specific game environment, and their recent performance trends. Here are the key features you would need to implement, categorised by their impact:

### Core Performance Engine (Player's Baseline)
These features establish a player's fundamental skills and role, which are crucial for accumulating points, rebounds, and assists.

*   **Usage Rate (USG%)**: This is arguably the **single most important feature for predicting any volume-based statistic**, including points, rebounds, and assists. It measures the percentage of a team's offensive possessions a player "uses," and a high usage rate is necessary for a player to accumulate high counting stats.
*   **Scoring Efficiency (PSA)**: Points Per 100 Shot Attempts (PSA) directly measures individual scoring efficiency and is **indispensable for predicting points**, a component of PRA.
*   **Playmaking (AST% & AST:Usg)**: Assist Percentage (AST%) measures the percentage of teammate field goals a player assists on, while the Assist-to-Usage ratio (AST:Usg) refines this by contextualising playmaking relative to overall offensive involvement. These are **foundational features for modelling assist props**.
*   **Rebounding (fgOR% & fgDR%)**: Offensive Rebound Percentage (fgOR%) and Defensive Rebound Percentage (fgDR%) provide a more accurate representation of a player's rebounding skill by accounting for opportunity. These are **key for rebound props**.
*   **Holistic Advanced Metrics**: Metrics like Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Win Shares (WS), and Box Plus/Minus (BPM) distil a player's overall on-court impact and have been shown to correlate strongly with a player's overall value.

### Contextual Modulators (Game-Specific Environment)
These features adjust a player's baseline expectation based on the specific circumstances of an upcoming game, which directly impact their opportunities to achieve PRA.

*   **Minutes Played (Minutes_L5_Mean)**: The **most fundamental measure of opportunity**. A projection is meaningless without an accurate estimate of how many minutes a player will be on the court. A simple moving average over the last 5 games is recommended.
*   **Opponent Matchup**: Key features include the **opponent's overall defensive rating** and their **pace** (possessions per game). Crucially, "Defense vs. Position" statistics (e.g., average points, rebounds, assists allowed to the player's position) directly measure the difficulty of the individual matchup and are **highly significant modulators** for PRA.
*   **Team Dynamics & Pace (Opp_Pace_S)**: A player's own team's style and the opponent's season-long pace are important, as a faster-paced game offers more possessions and thus more statistical opportunities for all players, impacting PRA.
*   **Situational Factors (Days_Rest, Is_B2B)**: Features capturing the number of days of rest since the last game (`Days_Rest`) and whether the game is the second of a back-to-back set (`Is_B2B`) are important to account for potential fatigue or resting, which can affect PRA.
*   **Lineup Configuration & Injuries (On_Off_USG_Delta)**: Player availability is the **most dynamic and impactful contextual factor**. When a key player is injured, an "opportunity vacuum" is created, redistributing their usage among teammates. The `On_Off_USG_Delta` feature quantifies changes in a player's Usage Rate when a specific key teammate is off the court, providing a **powerful predictive signal** that betting markets are often slow to fully price in. This is critical for PRA as it directly impacts a player's share of offensive and rebounding opportunities.

### Temporal Dynamics (Capturing Player Form)
These features track a player's recent performance to capture trends and differentiate current form from season-long averages.

*   **Rolling Averages (e.g., Minutes_L5_Mean)**: Simple moving averages of key statistics over various windows (e.g., last 5, 10, and 15 games) are fundamental for modelling a player's current form, offering a more timely estimate than season-long averages.
*   **Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) (e.g., USG%_L15_EWMA, PSA_L15_EWMA)**: These enhance simple moving averages by assigning greater weight to more recent performances, creating a more responsive measure of current form and adapting quickly to hot or cold streaks in usage and scoring efficiency.
*   **Performance Volatility (e.g., PTS_Volatility_L15)**: Calculating the standard deviation of a player's key stats (like points, or even an aggregated PRA) over a recent window (e.g., last 15 games) measures their consistency or volatility. This is crucial for risk assessment in betting.

By focusing on these diverse and context-rich features, particularly those directly impacting a player's opportunities for scoring, rebounding, and assisting, you can build a comprehensive foundation for predicting PRA.
