## Performance by Edge Size

**The model is BACKWARDS - most confident bets lose money:**

```
Edge Size        Bets    Win Rate    ROI       Profit

Small (3-5 pts)   586     53.58%    +4.44%    +$2,602  ✓
Medium (5-7 pts)  505     50.10%    -2.68%    -$1,355  ✗
Large (7-10 pts)  566     53.00%    +2.45%    +$1,388  ✓
Huge (10+ pts)    838     51.31%    -0.45%      -$376  ✗
```

**Problem:** Large edges (10+ pts) have the WORST win rate at 51.31%.

---

## Season Comparison

### 2023-24 vs 2024-25 (Both Walk-Forward Validated)

```
Metric              2023-24        2024-25        Change

Win Rate            51.19%         51.98%         +0.79 pp
ROI                 +5.35%         +0.91%         -4.44 pp
Total Profit        $13,936        $2,259         -$11,677
MAE                 10.08 pts      9.92 pts       -0.16 pts
CLV Rate            68.0%          73.7%          +5.7 pp
```

**Finding:** Both seasons show barely profitable performance (~52% win rate).

---

## The Journey: How We Got Here

### Phase 1: Initial Backtest (Overly Optimistic)
```
2023-24 Original Results:
- Win Rate: 87.81%
- ROI: +78.95%
- Assessment: "ELITE MODEL"
```

**Problem:** CTG duplicate bug inflating results.

---

### Phase 2: Fixed Duplicates
```
2023-24 Corrected Results:
- Win Rate: 79.66%
- ROI: +61.98%
- Assessment: "EXCEPTIONAL BUT NEEDS VALIDATION"
```

**Problem:** Temporal leakage in validation set.

---

### Phase 3: Discovered Temporal Leakage
```
2024-25 With Leakage:
- Win Rate: 99.35%
- ROI: +94.88%
- Assessment: "TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE"
```

**Problem:** Lag features using future game data.

---

### Phase 4: Walk-Forward Validation (REALITY)
```
2024-25 Walk-Forward:
- Win Rate: 51.98%
- ROI: +0.91%
- Assessment: "BELOW BREAKEVEN - NOT READY"
```

**Status:** TRUE OUT-OF-SAMPLE PERFORMANCE REVEALED ✓

---

## What This Means

### For Betting
```
❌ DO NOT bet real money
❌ Model loses money in expectation
❌ Win rate (51.98%) < Breakeven (52.38%)
❌ ROI too thin for reliable profits
```

### For Development
```
✓ CLV signal is strong (73.7% - ELITE)
✓ Edge detection works
✓ Issues are likely fixable
✓ 6-12 months to production realistic
```

### For Investors
```
❌ Current model: NOT READY
✓ Development potential: GOOD
⚠ Success probability: 60%
⚠ Timeline: 6-12 months
```

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue #1: Poor Feature Engineering
```
Missing Features:
- CTG advanced stats (usage rate, true shooting %)
- Opponent defensive metrics
- Rest days and back-to-backs
- Home/away splits
- Lineup combinations
- Injury status

Impact: MAE increased from 4.82 to 9.92 points
```

---

### Issue #2: Model Miscalibration
```
Training Data:  Rich features, accurate predictions
Validation Data: Poor features, less accurate predictions

Result: Model confidence (edge size) not aligned with accuracy

Evidence: Large edges (10+ pts) have 51.31% win rate
         Small edges (3-5 pts) have 53.58% win rate
```

---

### Issue #3: Temporal Leakage Discovery
```
Without Walk-Forward:  99.35% win rate (using future data)
With Walk-Forward:     51.98% win rate (using only past data)

Difference: 47.37 percentage points of FAKE performance
```

## Industry Benchmark Reality

```
Metric          Our Model    Good       Elite      Status

Win Rate        51.98%       54-56%     58-60%     BELOW ❌
ROI             +0.91%       3-5%       8-12%      POOR ❌
MAE             9.92 pts     4-5 pts    3.5-4 pts  POOR ❌
CLV Rate        73.7%        20-30%     40-50%     ELITE ✓
```

**Paradox:** ELITE at finding edges, POOR at winning bets.

## The Path Forward

### Immediate (Week 1)
```
1. DO NOT deploy to production
2. DO NOT bet real money
3. Understand root causes
```

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
```
4. Add missing features (CTG, opponent, rest)
5. Implement calibration (isotonic regression)
6. Target: Reduce MAE to <7 points
```

### Medium-term (Months 2-6)
```
7. Develop minutes projection model
8. Add injury tracking
9. Build lineup analysis
10. Target: Achieve 55%+ win rate
```

### Long-term (Months 7-12)
```
11. Multi-season validation (2022-23, 2021-22)
12. Live testing (3 months, small stakes)
13. Production deployment (if all criteria met)
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

```
Performance:       0/6  ❌
Technical:         2/6  ⚠️
Risk Management:   0/4  ❌
Business:          0/4  ❌

Total:             2/20 (10%)
```

**Status:** NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

---

## The Honest Assessment

### What We Thought We Had
```
🏆 Elite model with 79-99% win rate
💰 Generating $127K-$232K profit per season
🎯 Ready for immediate deployment
```

### What We Actually Have
```
⚠️ Barely profitable model with 52% win rate
💵 Generating $2K-$14K profit per season
🔧 Needs 6-12 months of development
```

### The Gap
```
- 30-40 percentage points of fake performance
- 90-99% of profit was illusory
- Months of additional work required
```

---

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Data Leakage is Insidious
```
99.35% win rate → 51.98% win rate when fixed
47 percentage points of FAKE performance
```

### 2. Walk-Forward Validation is Essential
```
Without it: Inflated results
With it: Realistic performance
Cost: Initial disappointment
Benefit: Truth and honest roadmap
```

### 3. Good Backtests Can Be Misleading
```
Initial: 87.81% win rate
Corrected: 79.66% win rate  
Walk-Forward: 51.98% win rate

Each "fix" revealed deeper issues
```

### 4. Features Matter More Than Models
```
With full features: 4.82 MAE
With limited features: 9.92 MAE

106% increase in error from missing features
```

### 5. CLV Doesn't Guarantee Profits
```
CLV: 73.7% (ELITE at finding edges)
Win Rate: 51.98% (POOR at converting edges)

Gap caused by poor calibration and accuracy
```

✓ 60% probability of reaching production standards
```

### The Verdict

**Continue development, but be realistic about timeline and probability of success.**
