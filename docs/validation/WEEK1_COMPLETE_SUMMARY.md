## Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Infrastructure Setup ‚úÖ
**Status**: Complete
**Time**: 2 hours

**Achievements**:
- MLflow tracking configured
- Pre-commit hooks (black, flake8, isort)
- Dev environment with uv package management
- Baseline experiment (revealed 0.28 MAE was due to leakage)

**Files Created**:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- `src/mlflow_integration/tracker.py`
- `scripts/training/baseline_experiment_mlflow.py`

---

### Day 2: Eliminate Temporal Leakage ‚úÖ
**Status**: Complete
**Time**: 8 hours
**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Revealed true baseline performance

**Problem Identified**:
- Baseline MAE of 0.28 was impossibly low
- Pre-calculated features contained future information
- Rolling averages included current game
- Lag features referenced validation period

**Solution Implemented**:
- On-the-fly feature calculation
- Walk-forward validation
- Features use ONLY past games

**Results**:
```
MAE: 0.28 ‚Üí 6.17 points (+2,107% increase!)
This is the TRUE baseline without leakage
```

**Key Learning**: "Perfect" results are often bugs. Better to know the truth early.

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/training/walk_forward_training_leak_free.py` (576 lines)
- `data/results/walk_forward_leak_free_2024_25.csv` (25,431 predictions)
- `docs/validation/WEEK1_DAY2_LEAK_FREE_RESULTS.md`

**MLflow Run**: 5c0e3a5d7eba43ef9fb934682ebdfebb

---

### Day 3: Full Training Dataset ‚úÖ
**Status**: Complete
**Time**: 2 hours
**Impact**: Minimal (1% improvement)

**Hypothesis**: Doubling training data will reduce MAE significantly

**Action**: Trained on all 204 dates instead of 100-date sample

**Results**:
```
Training samples: 11,327 ‚Üí 22,717 (2x increase)
MAE: 6.17 ‚Üí 6.11 points (improvement: 0.06 pts, 1.0%)
Train MAE: 4.36 ‚Üí 4.99 (worse - less overfitting)
```

**Key Learning**: 2x training data ‚Üí 1% improvement. Diminishing returns from data quantity alone.

**Files Created**:
- Modified `walk_forward_training_leak_free.py`
- `data/results/walk_forward_leak_free_FULL_2024_25.csv`
- `docs/validation/WEEK1_DAY3_FULL_TRAINING_RESULTS.md`

**MLflow Run**: 7f3055dffc9f4dff8c0af4a124e3c8a4

---

### Day 4: Advanced Features ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: Complete but disappointing
**Time**: 4 hours
**Impact**: Negligible (0.16% improvement)

**Hypothesis**: Adding opponent, efficiency, and normalization features will reduce MAE to 5.2-5.5

**Features Added** (13 new features):
1. **Opponent** (3): opp_DRtg, opp_pace, opp_PRA_allowed
2. **Efficiency** (5): TS%, PER, USG_per_36, PTS_per_shot, eFG%
3. **Normalization** (5): PRA_per_36, PTS/REB/AST_per_36, MIN_avg

**Results**:
```
Features: 34 ‚Üí 47 (+38%)
MAE: 6.11 ‚Üí 6.10 points (improvement: 0.01 pts, 0.16%)
Train MAE: 4.99 ‚Üí 4.89 (improved more than validation)
Training time: 1.5 ‚Üí 4.5 minutes (+200%)
```

**Feature Importance Analysis**:
- **ALL 3 opponent features had ZERO importance!**
  - opp_DRtg: 0.000
  - opp_pace: 0.000
  - opp_PRA_allowed: 0.000

- **Top 3 features dominate (76% of total importance)**:
  - PRA_ewma10: 47.4%
  - PRA_L20_mean: 18.4%
  - PRA_ewma5: 8.7%

- **Most new features have <1% importance**

**Key Learning**: Feature quantity ‚â† model quality. Poorly designed features (team-level opponent stats) add zero value.

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/training/walk_forward_training_advanced_features.py` (787 lines)
- `data/game_logs/all_game_logs_with_opponent.csv` (54,012 games)
- `data/results/walk_forward_advanced_features_2024_25.csv`
- `docs/validation/WEEK1_DAY4_ADVANCED_FEATURES_RESULTS.md`
- `feature_importance_day4.csv`

**MLflow Run**: b429e7ec622644a78ff2b263119b5b1d

---

### Day 5: Feature Selection & Optimization ‚ùå
**Status**: Complete but negative result
**Time**: 2 hours
**Impact**: Made things WORSE (-0.03 MAE)

**Hypothesis**: Removing low-importance features will reduce noise and improve generalization

**Action**: Trained with only top 25 features (removed 22 low-importance features)

**Results**:
```
Features: 47 ‚Üí 25 (-47%)
MAE: 6.10 ‚Üí 6.13 points (worse by 0.03 pts!)
Train MAE: 4.89 ‚Üí 5.04 (worse)
```

**Key Learning**: Even low-importance features contribute to model. Removing them hurts performance.

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/training/day5_feature_selection_optimization.py`
- `docs/validation/WEEK1_DAY5_FEATURE_SELECTION_RESULTS.md` (this would document the negative finding)

**MLflow Run**: 82148e2b02374fa2baa5328e2c32ef14

## Industry Context

### Current Performance vs Targets

**MAE: 6.10 points**
- **Elite systems**: 3.5-4.0 points
- **Good systems**: 4.0-5.0 points
- **Our system**: 6.10 points
- **Status**: 22-52% above elite range ‚ùå

**Estimated Betting Performance**:
- Win Rate: 52-53% (need 55%+ for profit)
- ROI: 2-4% before costs (need 5%+ after costs)
- **Status**: NOT profitable ‚ùå

### What It Would Take to Be Profitable

To achieve 55% win rate:
- **Need**: MAE < 5.0 points
- **Current**: MAE = 6.10 points
- **Gap**: 1.10 points (18% improvement needed)

This is **significant** and won't come from incremental tweaks.

---

## Honest Assessment

### What We Know Now

1. **TRUE Baseline**: 6.10-6.17 MAE (leak-free)
2. **Plateau Confirmed**: Can't improve beyond 6.10 with current approach
3. **Feature Importance**: EWMA >> rolling averages >> everything else
4. **Opponent Features**: Current implementation completely ineffective
5. **Model Capacity**: XGBoost with 300 trees may be saturated

### Probability of Reaching Targets

**By end of Week 2**:
- 5.5 MAE: 30% (would require breakthrough)
- 5.0 MAE: 10% (very unlikely)
- Profitable betting: 15% (extremely unlikely)

**By end of 12 weeks**:
- 5.5 MAE: 60% (with better opponent features)
- 5.0 MAE: 40% (with significant improvements)
- Profitable betting: 50% (with calibration + Kelly criterion)

### Why We're Stuck

1. **Opponent modeling is weak**: Team-level stats don't work
2. **Missing key features**: No real defensive metrics, no pace adjustments, no injury data
3. **Model may be saturated**: 300 trees might be capacity limit
4. **Data quality**: CTG covers 87%, but 13% missing may be important games
5. **Fundamental challenge**: NBA is high-variance - even perfect model has limits

## Path Forward: Week 2+

### What Won't Work (Based on Week 1)
‚ùå Adding more training data
‚ùå Adding random features without validation
‚ùå Feature selection
‚ùå Simple opponent proxies

### What Might Work

#### Short-term (Weeks 2-3): Polish Current Approach
**Target**: MAE 5.8-6.0 (realistic)

1. **Remove Only Zero-Importance Features** (1 hour)
   - Drop 4 features with 0.000 importance
   - Keep everything else (even low importance)
   - Expected: No harm, maybe tiny improvement

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning** (4 hours)
   - Grid search: n_estimators [500, 1000], max_depth [8, 10]
   - May squeeze out 0.1-0.2 MAE improvement
   - Expected: MAE 6.10 ‚Üí 6.00

3. **Ensemble with LightGBM** (4 hours)
   - Train LightGBM alongside XGBoost
   - Simple average of predictions
   - Expected: MAE 6.00 ‚Üí 5.90

#### Medium-term (Weeks 4-6): Better Opponent Features
**Target**: MAE 5.5-5.8

1. **Position-Specific Defense** (8 hours)
   - Track opponent defense by position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C)
   - Use defensive rating per position
   - Expected: MAE 5.90 ‚Üí 5.60

2. **Matchup History** (8 hours)
   - Track player vs specific team history
   - Use head-to-head performance
   - Expected: MAE 5.60 ‚Üí 5.50

3. **Real Defensive Metrics** (8 hours)
   - Opponent FG% allowed, 3P% allowed
   - Pace-adjusted stats
   - Expected: MAE 5.50 ‚Üí 5.40

#### Long-term (Weeks 7-12): Advanced Techniques
**Target**: MAE 5.0-5.3

1. **Deep Learning** (16 hours)
   - LSTM for sequence modeling
   - Attention mechanisms for key features
   - Expected: MAE 5.40 ‚Üí 5.20

2. **Injury & Minutes Projection** (12 hours)
   - Scrape injury reports
   - Project minutes based on rotation changes
   - Expected: MAE 5.20 ‚Üí 5.10

3. **Calibration & Betting Integration** (16 hours)
   - Isotonic regression for probability calibration
   - Kelly criterion for bet sizing
   - Convert MAE 5.10 to 55%+ win rate

## Conclusion

Week 1 was a **success** in establishing methodology and **failure** in reaching performance targets.

### Successes ‚úÖ
- Eliminated temporal leakage
- Established leak-free baseline (MAE 6.10-6.17)
- Built scalable, reproducible pipeline
- Integrated MLflow tracking
- Learned what doesn't work (critical knowledge!)

### Failures ‚ùå
- Did not reach MAE 5.2-5.5 target (got 6.10, 17% miss)
- Feature engineering strategies ineffective
- Hit performance plateau quickly
- Current approach insufficient for profitable betting

### Most Valuable Lesson
**"Perfect is the enemy of good, but honesty is essential."**

The jump from 0.28 ‚Üí 6.17 MAE (Day 2) was painful but necessary. Better to discover leakage in Week 1 than lose money in production.

### Key Insight for Week 2+
**Stop optimizing a flawed foundation. Rebuild opponent features properly.**

Current approach has been exhausted. Weeks 2+ must focus on fundamentally better features (position-specific defense, real matchup data) rather than incremental tweaks.

---

**Status**: Week 1 Complete ‚úÖ
**Confidence**: High (we know exactly where we stand)
**Timeline**: On schedule but behind on performance targets
**Recommendation**: Shift to medium-term strategy (better opponent features) for Weeks 2-4
