# üö® Temporal Leakage Proof - NBA Props Model

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - val.parquet had temporal leakage

---

## Executive Summary

We re-validated the 2023-24 season using proper walk-forward validation and **confirmed that the original 79.66% win rate was inflated by temporal leakage**.

The **true out-of-sample performance is ~51-52% win rate** across both seasons.

## üîç The Evidence

### 2023-24 Performance Comparison

| Metric | WITH Leakage<br>(val.parquet) | WITHOUT Leakage<br>(walk-forward) | Difference |
|--------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| **Win Rate** | 79.66% ‚úÖ | **51.19%** ‚ùå | **-28.47 pp** |
| **MAE** | 4.82 points | **8.83 points** | +4.01 pts |
| **ROI** | +61.98% | **+5.35%** | -56.63 pp |
| **Total Profit** | $127,685 | **$13,936** | -$113,749 |

### Cross-Season Validation

The walk-forward approach shows **remarkably consistent performance** across seasons:

| Season | Win Rate | ROI | MAE | Status |
|--------|----------|-----|-----|--------|
| 2023-24 (walk-forward) | **51.19%** | +5.35% | 8.83 pts | ‚úÖ Profitable |
| 2024-25 (walk-forward) | **51.98%** | +0.91% | 8.83 pts | ‚ö†Ô∏è Barely profitable |

**Average: 51.6% win rate** - This is the model's TRUE performance.

## üìä Detailed 2023-24 Walk-Forward Results

### Overall Performance
- **Total Bets**: 2,606
- **Win Rate**: 51.19% (need 52.38% to break even)
- **Won**: 1,334 bets (51.19%)
- **Lost**: 1,272 bets (48.81%)
- **Pushed**: 0 bets (0.00%)
- **Total Wagered**: $260,600
- **Total Profit**: $13,935.54
- **ROI**: +5.35%

### Performance by Edge Size

| Edge Range | Bets | Win Rate | ROI | Profit |
|------------|------|----------|-----|--------|
| Small (3-5 pts) | 688 | 49.4% | +0.10% | +$67 |
| Medium (5-7 pts) | 545 | 51.2% | +4.72% | +$2,572 |
| Large (7-10 pts) | 597 | **55.1%** | **+13.64%** | **+$8,141** ‚úÖ |
| Huge (10+ pts) | 776 | 49.7% | +4.07% | +$3,156 |

- **Within ¬±3 pts**: 22.7%
- **Within ¬±5 pts**: 36.6%

### Closing Line Value
- **3+ point edge**: 2,606 bets (68.0% of matched predictions)
- **Average edge (absolute)**: 6.38 points
- **Average edge (signed)**: +1.97 points

## üî¨ What Caused the Temporal Leakage?

### The Problem: val.parquet Lag Features

The original `val.parquet` file contained lag features that were **computed using all games in the 2023-24 season**, not just past games.

**Example of Leakage**:
```
Game on Dec 15, 2023:
  - PRA_L10_mean in val.parquet: Average of player's last 10 games (Oct-Dec)
  - Problem: This average INCLUDES games from Nov-Dec that happened AFTER Oct games

Proper walk-forward:
  - PRA_L10_mean on Dec 15: Only uses games BEFORE Dec 15
  - Each prediction is truly out-of-sample
```

### How We Fixed It

1. **Load raw game logs** without pre-computed lag features
2. **Walk forward chronologically** through the season
3. **Calculate lag features on-the-fly** using only past games for each prediction
4. **Train model on 2003-2023** data only (excluding 2023-24)

**Code Pattern** (walk_forward_validation_2023_24.py:133-148):
```python
for pred_date in unique_dates:
    games_today = raw_gamelogs[raw_gamelogs['GAME_DATE'] == pred_date]

    # CRITICAL: Only use games BEFORE this date
    past_games = raw_gamelogs[raw_gamelogs['GAME_DATE'] < pred_date]

    for game in games_today:
        player_history = past_games[past_games['PLAYER_ID'] == player_id]
        lag_features = calculate_lag_features(player_history)  # Only past data
        prediction = model.predict(lag_features)
```

## üéØ Implications

### 1. Model Performance is NOT Elite

The model's **true performance is ~51-52% win rate**:
- **Below breakeven** at 52.38% needed with -110 juice
- **Far below "good"** (54-56% industry benchmark)
- **Not close to elite** (58-60% for top models)

### 2. The 79.66% Was Too Good to Be True

Red flags we should have caught:
- ‚úÖ 79.66% win rate is unrealistic (professionals hit 58-60% max)
- ‚úÖ 4.82 MAE too low compared to historical performance
- ‚úÖ CLV of 50.6% too mediocre for an 80% model
- ‚úÖ No validation on fresh season (2024-25)

### 3. Walk-Forward Validation is Essential

This proves the critical importance of:
- ‚úÖ **Temporal isolation** - No future data in features
- ‚úÖ **Multi-season validation** - Test on multiple fresh seasons
- ‚úÖ **Realistic expectations** - 80% win rate should trigger investigation

### 4. The Model is Barely Profitable

Even with the +5.35% ROI on 2023-24:
- Win rate (51.19%) is still below breakeven (52.38%)
- Small sample variance could easily turn this negative
- Not stable enough for production betting

## üìà Performance Gap Analysis

### Why the 28-Point Win Rate Drop?

1. **Lag Feature Leakage** (Primary Cause)
   - `PRA_L10_mean`, `PRA_L20_std`, `PRA_ewma` all computed using future games
   - Reduced MAE from 8.83 ‚Üí 4.82 artificially
   - Inflated predictions by having "perfect" recent performance

2. **Missing Features in Walk-Forward** (Secondary Cause)
   - Walk-forward uses ~95 features
   - Original model trained on 188 features
   - Missing: CTG stats, opponent features, rest/schedule context
   - This explains why MAE is 8.83 instead of 4.82

3. **Model Overfitting** (Possible Contributor)
   - XGBoost with 500 trees, max_depth=6
   - May have overfit to 2003-2023 patterns
   - Doesn't generalize well to 2023-24 and 2024-25

## üöÄ Next Steps

Based on these findings, we need to:

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. ‚úÖ **Re-validate 2023-24** - DONE (51.19% confirmed)
2. ‚è≥ **Fix edge calculation** - DONE (edge_calculator.py created)
3. ‚è≥ **Apply calibration slope** - Fix large-edge predictions
4. ‚è≥ **Impute missing features** - Reduce missing lag features

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Weeks 2-3)
5. ‚è≥ **Add CTG advanced stats** - USG%, TS%, AST%, REB%
6. ‚è≥ **Add opponent features** - Defensive rating, pace, matchup
7. ‚è≥ **Add rest/schedule** - Back-to-backs, days rest, travel
8. ‚è≥ **Add L3 recent form** - Last 3 games (strongest predictor)

**Target**: Reduce MAE from 8.83 to <5 points, improve win rate to 54-56%

## üèÅ Conclusion

### The Good News ‚úÖ
- Walk-forward validation works correctly
- Model is consistently ~51-52% across seasons
- We identified and fixed the temporal leakage
- Still slightly profitable (+5.35% ROI on 2023-24)

### The Bad News ‚ùå
- 79.66% was a mirage caused by data leakage
- True performance (51%) is below breakeven (52.38%)
- Model needs significant improvements before production
- MAE of 8.83 is too high (need <5)

### The Reality Check üéØ

**This model is NOT ready for production betting.**

We need:
- 3-6 months of improvements (feature engineering, calibration, optimization)
- Target: 55-58% win rate consistently across multiple seasons
- Better features to reduce MAE to <5 points
- Proper calibration to fix edge predictions

**Estimated timeline to production:** 3-6 months
