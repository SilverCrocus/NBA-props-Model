# NBA Props Model - Critical Findings and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Your model evaluation notebook shows **severe issues** that would lead to catastrophic betting losses if deployed. The R² values of 0.988-0.996 are impossible for real NBA predictions and indicate fundamental problems with your data and approach.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Synthetic Target Variable**
- **Problem**: Your `PRA_estimate` is calculated from features using this formula:
  ```python
  PRA_estimate = MIN * USG% * PSA / 500 + MIN * fgDR% * 10 + MIN * AST% * 5
  ```
- **Impact**: The model is learning to reverse-engineer a mathematical formula, not making real predictions
- **Evidence**: Correlation of 0.977 between the formula and target

### 2. **Data Leakage**
- **Problem**: Features like `Opportunity_Score` (R² = 0.95 with target) contain the target formula
- **Impact**: Model appears to perform perfectly but has zero predictive power
- **Features to Remove**:
  - Opportunity_Score
  - Efficiency_x_Volume
  - Minutes_x_Efficiency
  - Playmaking_Efficiency

### 3. **Overfitting**
- **Problem**: Complex models (Neural Net with 100-50 neurons) on only 503 samples
- **Impact**: Model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns
- **Evidence**: Test MAE (0.356) < CV MAE (0.482) - opposite of expected

### 4. **Poor Calibration**
- **Problem**: Prediction intervals cover only 56% when targeting 80%
- **Impact**: Model is overconfident, leading to bad betting decisions

### 5. **Code Errors**
- **Problem**: `X_test_scaled` undefined, inconsistent variable naming
- **Impact**: Notebook doesn't run end-to-end

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Feature Audit Script** (`scripts/feature_audit.py`)
- Identifies and removes data leakage features automatically
- Creates cleaned dataset
- Tests for formula-based targets

### 2. **Fixed Evaluation Notebook** (`notebooks/05_model_evaluation_fixed.ipynb`)
- Three-way split (train/val/test)
- Simple models appropriate for 503 samples
- Proper preprocessing pipeline
- No data leakage

### 3. **Code Fixes**
- Fixed all `X_test_scaled` errors
- Consistent preprocessing for different model types
- Proper ensemble handling

## 📊 Realistic Performance Expectations

### Current (Fake) Performance
- R² = 0.988-0.996 ❌
- MAE = 0.35 ❌
- MAPE = 10% ❌

### Expected Real Performance
- **R² = 0.35-0.50** ✓
- **MAE = 3-5 points** ✓
- **MAPE = 25-35%** ✓

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### 1. **Get Real PRA Data** (CRITICAL)
```python
# Option 1: NBA API
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import playergamelog
gamelog = playergamelog.PlayerGameLog(player_id=player_id, season='2023-24')
df = gamelog.get_data_frames()[0]
df['PRA'] = df['PTS'] + df['REB'] + df['AST']

# Option 2: Scrape betting sites
# DraftKings, FanDuel historical lines and results
```

### 2. **Use Simple Models**
```python
# ONLY use these with 503 samples:
Ridge(alpha=10.0)        # Best choice
Lasso(alpha=1.0)        # Alternative
XGBoost(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3)  # If you must use trees
```

### 3. **Collect More Data**
- Need minimum 2000+ player-game samples
- Include multiple seasons
- Add game context (opponent, home/away, rest days)

### 4. **Add Temporal Features**
- Last 5 games average
- Last 10 games average
- Season-to-date average
- Trend (improving/declining)

## 🏀 Feature Engineering Priorities

### Keep These Core Features
- `USG_percent` - Usage rate
- `MIN` - Minutes played
- `AST_percent` - Assist percentage
- `Total_REB_percent` - Rebound percentage
- `eFG_percent` - Effective field goal percentage
- `TOV_percent` - Turnover percentage

### Add These New Features
- **Recent Performance**: Rolling averages (5, 10 games)
- **Matchup Data**: Opponent defensive rating, pace
- **Context**: Home/away, back-to-back games, rest days
- **Health**: Injury reports, minutes restrictions

## 📈 Model Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Weeks 1-2)
1. Scrape real PRA data from NBA games
2. Collect at least 2000 player-games
3. Include 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Week 3)
1. Create temporal features (rolling averages)
2. Add game context features
3. Engineer matchup-specific features

### Phase 3: Model Training (Week 4)
1. Start with Ridge regression baseline
2. Use proper train/val/test split
3. Implement time-based validation

### Phase 4: Evaluation (Week 5)
1. Test on future games (not in training)
2. Calculate realistic metrics (MAE = 3-5)
3. Assess betting performance

### Phase 5: Production (Week 6+)
1. Deploy only if MAE < 5 points
2. Monitor daily for drift
3. Retrain weekly with new data

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't chase high R² values** - They're unrealistic for sports
2. **Don't use complex models** with small datasets
3. **Don't ignore temporal structure** - sports data is time-dependent
4. **Don't trust synthetic targets** - always use real game outcomes
5. **Don't deploy without backtesting** on real betting lines

## 🎰 Betting Strategy Recommendations

### When Model is Ready
1. **Minimum Edge**: Only bet with 5%+ expected value
2. **Bankroll Management**: Use Kelly Criterion for sizing
3. **Line Shopping**: Compare across multiple sportsbooks
4. **Tracking**: Log all bets and outcomes for analysis
5. **Limits**: Never risk more than 2% of bankroll per bet

### Red Flags to Watch
- Model confidence > 70% on any single bet
- Predictions far from market consensus
- Sudden performance degradation
- High correlation between consecutive predictions

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Your current model is learning to reverse-engineer a formula, not predict real NBA performance. This is a common mistake but easily fixed:

1. **Get real data** - This is non-negotiable
2. **Simplify models** - Ridge regression will outperform neural nets with 503 samples
3. **Add temporal features** - Recent performance matters most
4. **Be realistic** - MAE of 3-5 points is good for NBA

Remember: A simple model with R² = 0.45 on real data is infinitely better than R² = 0.99 on synthetic data.
