- Position-adjusted defense (DvP)
- Temporal opponent DRtg trends (L5/L10/L20)
- Opponent pace trends
- Matchup advantage calculation

## Critical Data Leakage Fix

### Problem Discovered

During initial training, 4 features were using **current game statistics** (data leakage):

| Feature | Importance | Issue |
|---------|------------|-------|
| `PRA_per_100` | 19.7% | Uses current game PRA |
| `PTS_per_100` | 8.9% | Uses current game PTS |
| `AST_per_100` | 0.8% | Uses current game AST |
| `REB_per_100` | 0.7% | Uses current game REB |

**Combined Importance:** 30.2% of total model importance

These features calculated `stat / estimated_possessions` **without** temporal isolation (.shift(1)), effectively giving the model the answer.

### Fix Applied

Removed all `per_100` features that don't have `_L` (lag indicator) in the name:
```python
leaked_per_100 = [col for col in phase1_features if 'per_100' in col and '_L' not in col]
phase1_features = [col for col in phase1_features if col not in leaked_per_100]
```

Only lagged versions remain: `PTS_per_100_L5`, `PTS_per_100_L10`, `PTS_per_100_L20`, etc.

### Impact

| Metric | With Leakage | Without Leakage | Difference |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Training MAE | 2.79 | 3.93 | +1.14 pts |
| Validation MAE | 2.90 | 4.06 | +1.16 pts |
| Test MAE | 2.92 | 4.06 | +1.14 pts |

**Interpretation:** The 2.9 MAE was artificially low due to leakage. The TRUE performance is 4.06 MAE, which is still **45% better than baseline** (7-9 points).

## Model Validation

### Health Checks

| Check | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Train/Val Gap** | ✅ PASS | 3.3% (< 20% threshold) |
| **Negative Predictions** | ✅ PASS | 0 across all splits |

| **Data Retention** | ✅ PASS | 99.7% |
| **Temporal Isolation** | ✅ PASS | All features use .shift(1) |

### Performance Improvement

```
Baseline (FIXED_V2):
├─ Training MAE: 6-8 points
├─ Validation MAE: 7-9 points
└─ Test MAE: 8-10 points

Phase 1:
├─ Training MAE: 3.93 points (-45%)
├─ Validation MAE: 4.06 points (-45%)
└─ Test MAE: 4.06 points (-49%)
```

**Verdict:** Phase 1 features provide substantial predictive power without data leakage.

## Next Steps

### 1. Walk-Forward Validation on 2024-25 Season
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

Run walk-forward backtest using `production_model_PHASE1_latest.pkl` on 2024-25 data to validate:

- **Expected ROI:** 3-8% (improved from 1.06%)

**Script to run:**
```bash
uv run scripts/validation/walk_forward_validation_PHASE1.py

### 2. Apply Calibration
If walk-forward validation shows systematic bias, apply isotonic calibration using leak-free method from `train_calibrator_simple.py`.

### 3. Ultra-Selective Strategy
Apply the 4-tier quality scoring strategy to Phase 1 predictions to filter for highest-confidence bets.

### 4. Production Deployment
If validation confirms 54-55% win rate:
- Deploy `production_model_PHASE1_latest.pkl` to production
- Update prediction pipeline to include Phase 1 features

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Validate for Data Leakage
The initial 2.9 MAE was too good to be true - and it was. The `per_100` features were using current game stats. **Lesson:** If MAE is suspiciously low, audit top features for leakage.

### 2. Feature Engineering > Model Complexity
Adding 68 properly-engineered features reduced MAE by 45% without changing the model architecture. **Lesson:** Focus on features before hyperparameters.

### 3. Temporal Isolation is Critical
All features must use `.shift(1)` before any calculations. **Lesson:** Build temporal isolation into the feature calculation functions, not as an afterthought.

### 4. Integration Testing Catches Issues
The integration test (`test_phase1_features.py`) verified no data loss, no leakage, and proper feature counts. **Lesson:** Test features in isolation before training.

## Conclusion

Phase 1 feature engineering successfully reduced MAE from 7-9 points to **4.06 points** (45% improvement) using research-backed features with proper temporal isolation.

The model is now ready for walk-forward validation on 2024-25 season to verify the expected **54-55% win rate** improvement.

**Expected Impact on Betting:**
- Baseline: 52.94% win rate, 1.06% ROI
- Phase 1 Target: 54-55% win rate, 3-8% ROI
- If successful: $1,000 → $1,030-1,080 per 100 bets
