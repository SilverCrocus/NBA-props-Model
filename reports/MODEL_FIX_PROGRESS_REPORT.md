# Model Fix Progress Report - October 20, 2025

## üéØ Executive Summary

We successfully fixed **3 of 5 critical issues** in the NBA Props model:

‚úÖ **FIXED:**
1. Negative predictions eliminated (0 in all splits)
2. Data retention improved (41% ‚Üí 99.7%)
3. Train/Val gap healthy (77% ‚Üí 8.8%)

‚ùå **STILL BROKEN:**
4. MAE unrealistically low (1.44 vs expected 7-9)
5. **ROOT CAUSE:** In-game feature leakage (FGA, MIN, FG_PCT)

**Status:** Model is NOT ready for production betting until Phase 2 fixes applied.

## üìã Phase 1 Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: DNP Game Filtering ‚úÖ
**Before:** DNP/garbage time games (MIN < 10) polluted lag features
**After:** Filtered 85,457 games with MIN < 10
**Impact:** Prevents predictions based on non-meaningful games

### Fix #2: Vectorized CTG Merge ‚úÖ
**Before:** O(N¬≤) loop took 2-4 hours
**After:** Vectorized pandas merge takes 2-3 minutes
**Impact:** 50-100x speed improvement

### Fix #3: Data Imputation ‚úÖ
**Before:** Dropped 59% of data (346K games) due to NaN
**After:** Retained 99.7% of data (500K games) with imputation
**Impact:** +131% more training data

### Fix #4: Train/Val/Test Splits ‚úÖ
**Before:** No validation, trained on all data
**After:** Temporal splits (Train: 2003-2023, Val: 2023-24, Test: 2024-25)
**Impact:** Proper evaluation, no temporal leakage in splits

### Fix #5: XGBoost Regularization ‚úÖ
**Before:** `max_depth=6, lr=0.05, gamma=0`
**After:** `max_depth=4, lr=0.01, gamma=0.1, reg_alpha=0.1, reg_lambda=5`
**Impact:** Train/Val gap reduced from 77% ‚Üí 8.8%

### Fix #6: Non-Negative Constraint ‚úÖ
**Before:** `objective='reg:squarederror'` allowed negative predictions
**After:** `objective='reg:gamma'` enforces PRA > 0
**Impact:** 0 negative predictions (vs multiple before)

## üìä Model Performance After Phase 1 Fixes

| Metric | Before Fixes | After Phase 1 | Target | Status |

## üîç REMAINING ISSUE: In-Game Feature Leakage

### Feature Importance Analysis

**Top 5 features:**
1. **FGA (27.1%)** - ‚ùå Field goal attempts in current game (unknown pre-game!)
2. **PRA_ewma15 (16.9%)** - ‚úÖ Lag feature (valid)
3. **MIN (14.0%)** - ‚ùå Minutes in current game (unknown pre-game!)
4. **PRA_ewma10 (11.3%)** - ‚úÖ Lag feature (valid)
5. **FG_PCT (7.2%)** - ‚ùå Shooting % in current game (unknown pre-game!)

### The Problem

**In-game stats (FGA, MIN, FG_PCT, FTA, FT_PCT) create data leakage:**

1. **Training scenario:**
   - Model sees: "Player played 35 MIN, took 20 FGA, shot 50% FG"
   - Model learns: "When MIN=35 and FGA=20 ‚Üí predict ~25 PRA"
   - **This is VALID** because we know these stats after the game

2. **Prediction scenario (BROKEN):**
   - Model needs: "Player will play ? MIN, take ? FGA, shoot ? FG%"
   - **We DON'T KNOW these values before the game!**
   - Current script uses LAST GAME values (e.g., last game MIN=1 for Jarrett Allen)
   - **This is INVALID** and causes garbage predictions

### Why MAE is Artificially Low

The model is essentially solving:
```
PRA = f(FGA, MIN, FG_PCT, ...)
```

This is easy to predict IN-SAMPLE (hence MAE 1.44), but **impossible to use for betting** because we don't know FGA/MIN before the game!

**Analogy:** It's like predicting a student's test score AFTER seeing their answer sheet. Yes, you'll be accurate, but it's useless for prediction.

## üõ†Ô∏è PHASE 2 FIXES REQUIRED (Not Yet Implemented)

### Critical: Remove In-Game Features

**Files to modify:**
- `scripts/production/train_model_FIXED.py` (line 185)
- `scripts/production/predict_oct22_FIXED.py` (to be created)

**Changes:**

**BEFORE (current):**
```python
core_stats = ['MIN', 'FGA', 'FG_PCT', 'FG3A', 'FG3_PCT',
              'FTA', 'FT_PCT', 'OREB', 'DREB', 'STL', 'BLK', 'TOV', 'PF']
```

**AFTER (Phase 2):**
```python
# Only use PRE-GAME features:
core_stats = []  # Remove all in-game stats

# Use only lag features + CTG stats:
feature_cols = lag_features + ctg_features + contextual_features

# Where:
lag_features = ['PRA_lag1', 'PRA_L5_mean', 'PRA_ewma15', etc.]
ctg_features = ['CTG_USG', 'CTG_PSA', 'CTG_AST_PCT', etc.]
contextual_features = ['Days_Rest', 'Is_BackToBack', 'OPP_DRtg', 'Minutes_Projected']
```

### Add Minutes Projection Feature

**Why needed:** If we remove MIN from features, model needs to estimate expected playing time

**Implementation:**
```python
# Calculate player's typical minutes (L5 average)
df['Minutes_Projected'] = df.groupby('PLAYER_ID')['MIN'].shift(1).rolling(5, min_periods=1).mean()

# Use this instead of actual MIN as a feature
```

### Expected Results After Phase 2

| Metric | After Phase 1 | After Phase 2 (Expected) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Training MAE** | 1.44 pts | **6-7 pts** | Realistic |
| **Validation MAE** | 1.57 pts | **7-8 pts** | Realistic |
| **Test MAE** | 1.55 pts | **8-10 pts** | Realistic |
| **Feature importance** | FGA 27.1% | PRA_ewma15 ~30% | Lag features dominate |
| **Usable for betting?** | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES | Production-ready |

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option 1: Use Current Model (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- Already trained
- No negative predictions
- Can generate predictions for Oct 22

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå MAE artificially low (not trustworthy)
- ‚ùå Uses in-game stats (cheating)
- ‚ùå Predictions based on last game stats (broken for DNP games)
- ‚ùå **HIGH RISK for betting** - model hasn't truly learned

**Verdict:** Only use for demonstration/testing, NOT real betting

### Option 2: Implement Phase 2 Fixes (RECOMMENDED)

**Time required:** 2-3 hours

**Steps:**
1. Remove FGA, MIN, FG_PCT, FTA, FT_PCT from features (15 min)
2. Add Minutes_Projected feature (30 min)
3. Retrain model (10 min)
4. Verify MAE is 7-9 points (realistic) (15 min)
5. Run backtest on 2024-25 (30 min)
6. Generate Oct 22 predictions (10 min)
7. Validate predictions are realistic (15 min)

**Expected outcome:**
- ‚úÖ MAE 7-9 points (matches research)
- ‚úÖ No in-game feature leakage
- ‚úÖ Ready for production betting
- ‚úÖ 52-55% win rate expected

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (If Using Current Model)

Despite limitations, you CAN generate predictions for Oct 22 with caveats:

1. ‚úÖ Run prediction script (use last 5-game averages for "core stats")
2. ‚úÖ Generate betting recommendations
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Use conservative bet sizing** ($25-50 instead of $100)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Track results carefully** to validate model
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Don't trust large edges** (10+ pts likely wrong)

### Recommended (Phase 2 Fixes)

1. Implement "pre-game features only" version
2. Retrain with realistic MAE target (7-9 pts)
3. Backtest on full 2024-25 season
4. Validate win rate 52-55% (not 99%!)
5. THEN use for Oct 22 betting with confidence
