## How to Generate Predictions for Future Games

### Step 1: Collect Latest Odds
```bash
# (You'll need to manually download odds from your sportsbook)
# Save to: data/upcoming/odds_YYYY_MM_DD.csv
```

### Step 2: Generate Raw Predictions
```bash
# Use your existing prediction script
uv run python scripts/production/predict_upcoming_games.py
# Output: data/results/predictions_YYYY_MM_DD.csv
```

### Step 3: Apply Calibration
```bash
# Apply Phase 2 calibration
uv run python scripts/production/apply_calibration_oct22.py
# (Update date paths in script first)
# Output: data/results/betting_recommendations_YYYY_MM_DD_CALIBRATED.csv
```

## Key Model Improvements

### Phase 1: Betting Strategy (‚úÖ Implemented)
- **What:** Skip 10+ pt edges (model overconfident)
- **Why:** 10+ edges had 49.74% win rate (losing)
- **Impact:** Win rate 50.58% ‚Üí 52.03%

### Phase 2: Calibration (‚úÖ Implemented)
- **What:** Isotonic regression to fix systematic bias
- **Why:** Model predicted ~7 pts too low on average
- **Impact:** MAE reduced 26.7% (8.90 ‚Üí 6.52 pts)

### Combined Impact
- **Expected win rate:** 54-56%
- **Expected ROI:** +3-5%

---

## Betting Guidelines

### DO ‚úÖ
- Start with small bets ($25-50)
- Focus on highest confidence bets (top 5-10)
- Track every bet (player, line, pred, actual, win/loss)
- Re-evaluate after 20 bets
- Use calibrated predictions (not raw)

### DON'T ‚ùå
- Bet more than 5% of bankroll per bet
- Chase losses with larger bets
- Ignore tracking (you need data to improve)
- Use raw predictions (always apply calibration)
- Bet on star players (excluded by strategy)

---

## Performance Tracking

### After Each Bet, Record:
1. Player name
2. Game date
3. Predicted PRA (calibrated)
4. Betting line
5. Edge size
6. Bet type (OVER/UNDER)
7. Actual PRA
8. Win/Loss

### Calculate Weekly:
- **Win rate:** Should be 54-56%
- **ROI:** Should be +3-5%
- **MAE:** Should be 6-7 pts

### Red Flags üö©
- Win rate < 52% after 20 bets ‚Üí Re-evaluate strategy
- MAE > 8 pts for 2 weeks ‚Üí Re-calibrate model
- Mean residual > 2 pts ‚Üí Systematic bias returning

## Troubleshooting

### "Predictions too high/low"
- Check calibration was applied: `predicted_PRA_calibrated` column should exist
- Verify using calibrated model: `models/production_model_calibrated.pkl`

### "No bets passing filters"
- Check edge range: Should be 5-7 pts
- Verify star exclusion: 61 players excluded
- Confirm odds loaded: Should have betting lines

### "Win rate below 52%"
- Small sample variance: Need 20+ bets for significance
- Track over 2-3 weeks before re-evaluating
- If persistent, consider re-calibration

## Support & Updates

### When to Re-Calibrate
1. Win rate < 52% for 3+ weeks
2. MAE > 8 pts for 2+ weeks
3. Systematic bias detected (mean residual > 2 pts)

### How to Re-Calibrate
```bash
uv run python scripts/production/train_calibrated_model.py
```

This will:
1. Use latest backtest data
2. Fit new isotonic regressor
3. Save updated calibrated model
