PHASE 2: MODEL CALIBRATION REPORT
================================================================================

Date: 2025-10-20 16:23:53

CALIBRATION METHOD
------------------
- Isotonic Regression (non-parametric monotonic mapping)
- Splits: 80% calibration fitting, 20% validation
- Calibration samples: 20,344
- Validation samples: 5,087

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
-----------------------
- MAE before calibration: 8.90 pts
- MAE after calibration: 6.52 pts
- Improvement: 2.37 pts (26.7%)

CALIBRATION ADJUSTMENTS (Validation Set)
-----------------------
- Mean adjustment: 6.83 pts
- Median adjustment: 6.80 pts
- Std adjustment: 4.54 pts

RESIDUAL ANALYSIS (Validation Set)
-----------------
Before Calibration:
  - Mean residual: 7.22 pts
  - Residual std: 9.20 pts

After Calibration:
  - Mean residual: 0.38 pts
  - Residual std: 8.40 pts

EXPECTED BETTING IMPACT
-----------------------
Based on research literature and backtest analysis:
- Current Phase 1 win rate: 52.03%
- Expected Phase 2 win rate: 54-56% (+2-4 pp improvement)
- Mechanism: Reduced overconfidence â†’ better edge estimation

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Run backtest with calibrated model
2. Validate 54-56% win rate target
3. If successful, deploy to production
4. Monitor real-world performance
