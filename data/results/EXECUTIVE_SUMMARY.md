# Executive Summary: EDA Findings
## NBA Props Model Walk-Forward Validation (2024-25)

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Analysis Scope:** 23,204 predictions, 3,386 bets
**Key Outcome:** Model is fundamentally miscalibrated and currently unprofitable

---

## Critical Findings (Action Required)

### 1. **Edge Calculation is Fundamentally Broken** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Problem:** Edge calculated as simple difference (predicted_PRA - betting_line) without accounting for:
- Prediction uncertainty/variance
- Betting odds and vig
- Probability of winning vs losing

**Impact:**
- Positive edge bets (0-5%): Only 17.8% win rate (should be 52%)
- **Loss of 34.6 percentage points** on what model thinks are good bets
- Model betting on marginal calls that are actually -EV after vig

**Current Formula:**
```
edge = predicted_PRA - betting_line
```

**Correct Formula:**
```
edge = P(actual > line | prediction) - implied_probability_from_odds
where P accounts for prediction uncertainty (std deviation ~8 points)
```

**Fix Priority:** IMMEDIATE (before any more betting)

---

### 2. **Abnormally High Push Rate (26.3%)** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Problem:** Over 1 in 4 bets result in a push (no win/no loss)

**Normal Expectation:** 5-8% pushes
**Actual:** 26.3% (3.3× higher than normal)

**Root Cause:** Model predictions very close to betting lines, indicating:
- No genuine edge detection
- Market is more efficient than model
- Model may be overfitting to market lines

**Impact:**
- Capital tied up in non-productive bets
- Opportunity cost (missing real +EV opportunities)
- Suggests model needs stronger signal to identify true edges

---

### 3. **Systematic Under-Prediction Bias (-1.33 points)** 🟡 HIGH
**Problem:** Model under-predicts actual PRA by 1.33 points on average

**Breakdown by Range:**
- **0-10 PRA:** -5.32 points (severe under-prediction)
- **10-20 PRA:** -1.43 points (moderate)
- **20-30 PRA:** +0.78 points (slight over-prediction)
- **30-40 PRA:** +4.84 points (severe over-prediction)
- **40-50 PRA:** +8.10 points (critical over-prediction)
- **50+ PRA:** +15.87 points (catastrophic over-prediction)

**Pattern:** U-shaped error curve
- Under-predicts bench players
- Relatively accurate on rotation players
- Severely over-predicts star performances

---

### 4. **Inverted Edge Calibration** 🔴 CRITICAL

| Edge Range | Bets | Win Rate | Expected | Error | Verdict |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| **< -10%** | 576 | 53.5% | 35.8% | +17.7% | ✅ GOOD (negative edge = positive bets!) |
| **-10 to -5%** | 674 | 50.7% | 42.7% | +8.0% | ✅ GOOD |
| **-5 to 0%** | 886 | 23.6% | 47.4% | -23.8% | 🔴 POOR |
| **0 to 5%** | 591 | 17.8% | 52.4% | **-34.6%** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **5 to 10%** | 397 | 53.1% | 57.2% | -4.1% | 🟡 ACCEPTABLE |
| **> 10%** | 262 | 46.6% | 63.8% | -17.2% | 🔴 POOR |

**Key Insight:** Model's "bad bets" (negative edge) are actually winning at 51-54%, while "good bets" (positive edge) are losing at 18-31%. **The edge calculation is inverted.**

### 5. **Severe Player-Specific Biases** 🟡 HIGH

#### Most Over-Predicted Players (MAE > 18, min 10 games):
1. **Lauri Markkanen:** +23.3 points (predicts 49.8, actual 26.5)
2. **Anthony Davis:** +20.6 points (predicts 59.8, actual 39.2)
3. **Keegan Murray:** +20.2 points (predicts 40.5, actual 20.3)
4. **Chet Holmgren:** +19.1 points (predicts 43.0, actual 23.9)

**Pattern:** High usage players with role changes, injury-prone stars, sophomores with regression

#### Most Under-Predicted Players (MAE > 15, min 10 games):
1. **Brandon Miller:** -17.9 points (predicts 13.0, actual 30.9)
2. **Mark Williams:** -17.1 points (predicts 12.4, actual 29.5)
3. **Quentin Grimes:** -17.1 points (predicts 6.0, actual 23.1)
4. **Nikola Jokić:** -15.4 points (predicts 44.2, actual 59.6)

**Pattern:** Breakout players, role expansions, MVP-level outlier performances

## Data Quality Issues

### Missing Data (60 features with >5% missing)

| Feature Category | Missing Rate | Impact |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| 10-game lag features (PRA, PTS, REB, AST, MIN) | 17.1% | HIGH - missing early season data |
| 7-game lag features | 11.9% | MEDIUM - affects model accuracy |
| CTG shooting features (All Three %, FT%, etc.) | 11.7% | HIGH - missing advanced stats |

**Recommendation:** Implement cascade imputation (lag10 → lag7 → lag5 → season avg)

### Zero Variance Features
- **SEASON_ID:** Remove (all values = 2024-25)

---

## Betting Performance Summary

| Metric | Value | Target | Gap |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Total Bets** | 3,386 | - | - |
| **Wins** | 1,297 (38.3%) | 52.4% | **-14.1%** |
| **Losses** | 1,198 (35.4%) | 47.6% | +12.2% |
| **Pushes** | 891 (26.3%) | <10% | **+16.3%** |
| **ROI** | Unknown | >0% | Likely negative |

**Verdict:** **Model is currently unprofitable and should NOT be used for real betting**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why is the model failing?

1. **Edge Calculation Error (Primary)**
   - Treats predictions as certainties, not probabilities
   - Ignores prediction variance (~8 point MAE)
   - Close calls (pred ≈ line) flagged as positive edge
   - After accounting for vig, these are actually -EV

2. **Insufficient Contextual Features**
   - No opponent defense ratings
   - No injury/lineup context
   - No recent trend indicators (last 5 games)
   - No trade/role change flags

3. **Training Data Issues**
   - Min 5 games requirement too low (high variance)
   - Historical data doesn't capture current role/usage
   - Missing advanced shooting metrics (11.7%)

4. **Model Architecture Limitations**
   - Single model for all player types (stars + bench)
   - Linear assumptions for non-linear outcomes
   - Regression to mean on extreme predictions

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (This Week)

#### 1. **Rebuild Edge Calculation** [2-3 days]
```python
# Current (WRONG)
edge = predicted_PRA - betting_line

# Correct (probability-based)
pred_std = get_prediction_uncertainty(player, features)
prob_win = norm.cdf((predicted_PRA - betting_line) / pred_std)
implied_prob = get_implied_probability(odds)
edge = (prob_win - implied_prob) * 100
```

#### 2. **Apply Isotonic Regression Calibration** [1 day]
- Fit isotonic regression on validation set
- Map raw predictions → calibrated probabilities
- Ensure predicted probabilities match actual frequencies

#### 3. **Impute Missing Lag Features** [1 day]
- Cascade: lag10 → lag7 → lag5 → lag3 → season avg
- Add imputation flags to feature set
- Document imputation strategy

#### 4. **Set Minimum Edge Threshold** [Immediate]
- Only bet if |edge| > 5% (current: any positive edge)
- Filter out high-push-probability bets (±2 point range)
- Reduces bet volume but improves win rate

**Expected Impact:** Win rate 38% → 48-52%

---

### Phase 2: Model Improvements (Next 2 Weeks)

#### 5. **Add Contextual Features** [3-5 days]
- Opponent defensive rating (last 10 games)
- Team injury context (starters out → usage boost)
- Minutes trend (last 5 vs season average)
- Usage rate trend (recent spike indicator)
- Trade/roster change binary flag

#### 6. **Player-Specific Bias Corrections** [2-3 days]
- Calculate bias for each player with 20+ games
- Apply correction: `adjusted_pred = raw_pred - player_bias`
- Or: Add player random effects (mixed-effects model)

#### 7. **Separate Models by Player Archetype** [5-7 days]
- Model 1: Starters (>25 MPG, >30 PRA)
- Model 2: Rotation (15-25 MPG, 15-30 PRA)
- Model 3: Bench (<15 MPG, <15 PRA)
- Or: Use gradient boosting with player embeddings

**Expected Impact:** MAE 7.97 → 6.5-7.0, Win rate 48% → 53-55%

---

### Phase 3: System Hardening (Next Month)

#### 8. **Implement Prediction Intervals**
- Calculate 80% confidence intervals for each prediction
- Use interval width as uncertainty metric
- Only bet when: `|predicted - line| > 1.5 * prediction_std`

#### 9. **Real-Time Calibration Monitoring**
- Track daily win rate by edge bucket
- Alert if calibration error > 10%
- Auto-pause betting if model degrades

#### 10. **Ensemble Methods**
- Combine XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost
- Weight by recent validation performance
- Reduces overfitting, improves stability

**Expected Impact:** Win rate 53% → 55-57%, ROI → +3-5%

## What NOT to Bet (Until Fixed)

### ❌ Avoid These Bet Types:

1. **Positive Edge Bets (0-10%)** - Currently losing at 18-31% win rate
2. **High-PRA Player Overs (>40 PRA predicted)** - Model over-predicts by 8-16 points
3. **Low-Minutes Player Bets (<15 MPG)** - Too much variance, poor predictions
4. **Players with <10 games history** - Insufficient training data
5. **Bets where predicted ≈ line (±2 points)** - High push probability, poor edge

### ✅ Consider These (Experimental):

1. **Negative Edge Bets (-10 to 0%)** - Paradoxically winning at 51-54% (inverted edge)
2. **Mid-Range Unders (20-30 PRA)** - Model slightly over-predicts (+0.78)
3. **Star Player Unders (if predicted >50)** - Model over-predicts elite performances

**WARNING:** These are based on miscalibrated model. Re-evaluate after fixes.

## Success Metrics (Post-Fix)

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Win Rate** | 38.3% | >52.4% | Phase 1 (1 week) |
| **Edge Calibration Error** | -34.6% | <5% | Phase 1 (1 week) |
| **Push Rate** | 26.3% | <10% | Phase 1 (1 week) |
| **MAE** | 7.97 | <7.0 | Phase 2 (2 weeks) |
| **Player-Specific Bias** | ±20 pts | <±5 pts | Phase 2 (2 weeks) |
| **ROI** | Negative | >3% | Phase 3 (1 month) |

---

## Conclusion

The model has a **solid foundation** (MAE of 7.97 is competitive), but is currently **unprofitable due to edge miscalibration**. The primary issue is not the predictions themselves, but how those predictions are converted into betting decisions.

**Good News:**
- Prediction accuracy is reasonable (MAE ~8 points)
- Model captures general patterns correctly
- Clear path to profitability with targeted fixes

**Bad News:**
- Edge calculation is fundamentally broken
- Currently losing money on "positive edge" bets
- High push rate indicates weak signal detection

**Recommendation:** **HALT LIVE BETTING** until Phase 1 fixes are implemented. Focus on:
1. Rebuilding edge calculation (probability-based)
2. Calibrating predictions (isotonic regression)
3. Setting minimum edge thresholds (>5%)

With these fixes, model should reach breakeven (52.4% win rate) within 1-2 weeks, and profitability (>55% win rate) within 1 month.
