# Understanding Normality Test Results in NBA Player Statistics

## Executive Summary
All NBA player statistics in your dataset fail the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (p < 0.0001), which is **completely expected and not a problem** for your modeling approach. This document explains why this occurs and what it means for your NBA props model.

## 1. Why NBA Player Statistics Fail Normality Tests

### A. Inherent Structure of Sports Performance Data

NBA player statistics are inherently non-normal due to several factors:

#### **Role-Based Segmentation**
- NBA players fall into distinct role categories (stars, starters, rotation, bench)
- This creates **multimodal distributions** rather than single bell curves
- Example: Minutes played shows three distinct peaks around bench (300-600), rotation (900-1200), and starter (2000+) levels

#### **Natural Boundaries and Constraints**
- **Lower bounds at zero**: Players can't have negative statistics
- **Upper bounds from game rules**: Maximum 48 minutes per game, 100% usage rate
- **Discrete events**: Rebounds, assists, and turnovers are count data, not continuous

#### **Selection Bias**
- NBA players are already the top 0.01% of basketball players worldwide
- This represents the extreme right tail of the overall basketball talent distribution
- Statistics reflect elite performance, not population-normal behavior

### B. Statistical Characteristics Observed

Your data shows classic non-normal patterns:

| Feature | Skewness | Distribution Type | Reason |
|---------|----------|------------------|---------|
| USG_percent | +0.88 | Right-skewed | Most players have low-to-moderate usage; few stars dominate |
| PSA | -0.61 | Left-skewed | Efficiency clusters around league average with inefficient outliers |
| MIN | +0.47 | Bimodal/Trimodal | Distinct player role categories |
| AST_percent | +1.04 | Right-skewed | Most players aren't primary playmakers |
| Total_REB_percent | +1.04 | Right-skewed | Position-specific; guards rebound less |

## 2. Is This a Problem for Modeling?

**Short answer: No, it's not a problem at all.**

### Why Non-Normality Isn't an Issue:

#### **Modern ML Models Don't Assume Normality**
- Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) make no distributional assumptions
- Neural networks can learn any distribution
- Only linear regression assumes normally distributed residuals (not features)

#### **Non-Normality Can Be Informative**
- Skewness and multimodality capture real player archetypes
- Distribution shape contains predictive signal about player roles
- Outliers often represent star players who drive betting lines

#### **Real-World Predictive Power**
- Sports betting models routinely succeed with non-normal features
- The goal is prediction accuracy, not statistical purity
- Non-normal distributions often improve model interpretability

## 3. Implications for Feature Engineering

### Leverage Natural Distributions

**DO:**
- Keep raw features alongside any transformations
- Create categorical bins that respect natural breakpoints (starter/bench/rotation)
- Use percentile ranks for relative comparisons
- Engineer interaction terms between role-based features

**DON'T:**
- Force normality where it doesn't exist naturally
- Remove outliers that represent legitimate star players
- Assume transformations will always improve performance

### Recommended Feature Engineering Approaches:

```python
# 1. Role-based binning (respects multimodality)
df['minutes_role'] = pd.cut(df['MIN'], 
                            bins=[0, 600, 1500, 3000],
                            labels=['bench', 'rotation', 'starter'])

# 2. Percentile transformations (preserves relative ordering)
df['USG_percentile'] = df['USG_percent'].rank(pct=True)

# 3. Log transformations for right-skewed features (optional)
df['MIN_log'] = np.log1p(df['MIN'])  # log(1+x) to handle zeros

# 4. Robust scaling (handles outliers better than standard scaling)
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler
scaler = RobustScaler()
df['USG_robust'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['USG_percent']])
```

## 4. Model Selection Implications

### Recommended Models for Non-Normal NBA Data:

#### **Tier 1 (Best for Non-Normal Data):**
- **XGBoost/LightGBM**: Handle any distribution, built-in regularization
- **Random Forest**: No distributional assumptions, captures non-linear patterns
- **Neural Networks**: Universal approximators, learn complex distributions

#### **Tier 2 (Use with Caution):**
- **Linear/Logistic Regression**: May need feature transformations
- **SVM with RBF kernel**: Can handle non-linearity but sensitive to scale
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Explicitly assumes normality (avoid)

### Model-Specific Considerations:

```python
# For tree-based models - use raw features
xgb_model = XGBRegressor()
xgb_model.fit(X_raw, y)  # No transformation needed

# For linear models - consider transformations
from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer
pt = PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson')  # Handles zeros
X_transformed = pt.fit_transform(X_raw)
linear_model.fit(X_transformed, y)

# For neural networks - always standardize
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_raw)
neural_net.fit(X_scaled, y)
```

## 5. Common Distributions in Sports Analytics

### Typical Distribution Patterns:

| Statistic Type | Common Distribution | Characteristics |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Playing Time | Bimodal/Trimodal | Reflects role hierarchy |
| Scoring Efficiency | Left-skewed | Most players near average, few inefficient |
| Usage/Touch Rate | Right-skewed | Star player concentration |
| Counting Stats | Poisson-like | Discrete events with low probabilities |
| Percentages | Beta-like | Bounded between 0-100% |
| Plus/Minus | Roughly normal | Symmetric around zero |

### Why These Patterns Emerge:

1. **Pareto Principle**: 20% of players generate 80% of production
2. **Position Specialization**: Different positions have different statistical profiles
3. **Coaching Strategies**: Discrete rotation patterns create clustering
4. **Team Composition**: Star + role player structure creates bimodality

## 6. Practical Recommendations for Your Model

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Proceed with confidence** - Non-normality is expected and fine
2. **Start with XGBoost/LightGBM** - They handle non-normal data excellently
3. **Keep features raw initially** - Let the model learn the distributions
4. **Use cross-validation** - More important than distribution assumptions

### Feature Engineering Priority:

```python
# High Priority (always helpful)
- Interaction terms (USG% × Efficiency)
- Rolling averages (recent form)
- Matchup-specific features
- Team pace adjustments

# Medium Priority (test empirically)  
- Log transforms for counts
- Percentile ranks for comparisons
- Polynomial features for key metrics

# Low Priority (rarely needed)
- Forcing normality via Box-Cox
- Removing outliers
- Gaussianization techniques
```

### Validation Strategy:

```python
# Use stratified sampling to preserve distribution
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold

# Stratify by player role to maintain distribution balance
role_bins = pd.qcut(df['MIN'], q=3, labels=['low', 'med', 'high'])
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

for train_idx, val_idx in skf.split(X, role_bins):
    # This ensures each fold maintains the natural distribution
    X_train, X_val = X[train_idx], X[val_idx]
```

## Conclusion

The non-normal distributions in your NBA data are a **feature, not a bug**. They reflect the real structure of professional basketball - distinct player roles, position-specific skills, and star player effects. Modern machine learning models are designed to handle these distributions effectively.

**Key Takeaways:**
- ✅ Non-normality is expected in sports data
- ✅ Tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) are ideal for this data
- ✅ Focus on predictive accuracy, not distributional assumptions
- ✅ Engineer features that respect natural player groupings
- ✅ Use the distribution information to inform feature creation

Your model will likely perform **better** because it preserves the natural structure of NBA player performance rather than forcing artificial normality.
