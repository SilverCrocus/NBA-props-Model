# Normality Test Analysis Report
## NBA Props Model - Feature Distribution Analysis

**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Notebook:** `03_feature_exploration.ipynb`
**Dataset:** 503 NBA players from 2023-24 season

---

## Executive Summary

All features in the NBA dataset show **p-values of 0.0000** (< 0.0001) in Shapiro-Wilk normality tests. This finding is **expected and normal** for real-world sports statistics with a moderate to large sample size (n=503).

## Key Findings

### 1. Normality Test Results

| Feature | Shapiro-Wilk Statistic | P-value | Skewness | Kurtosis | Interpretation |
|---------|------------------------|---------|----------|----------|----------------|
| USG_percent | 0.944 | < 0.0001 | 0.877 | 0.444 | Right-skewed (few high-usage stars) |
| PSA | 0.966 | < 0.0001 | -0.615 | 2.042 | Slightly left-skewed, heavy tails |
| MIN | 0.929 | < 0.0001 | 0.466 | -0.994 | Right-skewed (starters vs bench) |
| AST_percent | 0.904 | < 0.0001 | 1.044 | 0.537 | Strongly right-skewed |
| fgDR_percent | 0.942 | < 0.0001 | 0.925 | 0.656 | Right-skewed |
| Total_REB_percent | 0.917 | < 0.0001 | 1.039 | 0.700 | Strongly right-skewed |

### 2. Why P-values = 0.0000

#### Statistical Reasons:
1. **Large Sample Size (n=503)**: Shapiro-Wilk test becomes extremely sensitive to minor deviations from normality
2. **Test Power**: With 503 observations, even trivial departures from perfect normality are statistically significant
3. **Precision**: P-values are actually < 0.0001, displayed as 0.0000 due to rounding

#### Data Characteristics:
1. **Natural Skewness**: NBA statistics inherently follow skewed distributions
   - Few star players with extreme values
   - Many role players with moderate values
   - Bench players with limited minutes/opportunities

2. **Bounded Data**:
   - Percentages cannot be negative (lower bound = 0)
   - Physical/practical upper limits exist
   - Creates asymmetric distributions

3. **Player Role Structure**:
   - Guards, forwards, and centers have distinct statistical profiles
   - Creates multimodal or mixed distributions
   - Position-specific roles affect stat distributions

### 3. Distribution Characteristics

#### Most Skewed Features (Skewness > 1.0):
- **AST_percent** (1.044): Point guards dominate assists
- **Total_REB_percent** (1.039): Centers dominate rebounding
- **fgDR_percent** (0.925): Position-dependent rebounding

#### Heavy-Tailed Features:
- **PSA** (Kurtosis = 2.042): Wide range of shooting efficiency
- **MIN** (Kurtosis = -0.994): Bimodal distribution (starters vs bench)

### 4. Transformation Analysis

Best transformations tested but still failed to achieve normality (p > 0.05):

| Feature | Best Transformation | Improved P-value | Skewness After |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| USG_percent | Yeo-Johnson (λ=-0.159) | 0.0069 | 0.002 |
| MIN | Box-Cox (λ=0.374) | < 0.0001 | -0.133 |
| AST_percent | Box-Cox (λ=-0.028) | 0.0001 | 0.004 |

**Key Insight**: Even optimal transformations cannot fully normalize NBA statistics due to inherent data structure.

### 5. Anderson-Darling Test Confirmation

All features significantly exceed critical values:
- USG_percent: Statistic = 9.08 >> Critical(1%) = 1.08
- PSA: Statistic = 4.10 >> Critical(1%) = 1.08
- MIN: Statistic = 10.91 >> Critical(1%) = 1.08

## Visual Analysis Summary

### Q-Q Plots:
- Clear S-shaped curves indicating systematic departures from normality
- Tails deviate significantly from theoretical normal quantiles
- Consistent pattern across all features

### Histograms:
- Visible right skewness in most features
- Some bimodal tendencies (especially MIN)
- Normal overlay shows poor fit at tails

### KDE vs Normal:
- Kernel density estimates show asymmetric, non-bell-shaped distributions
- Multiple peaks in some features suggest player role clustering

## Practical Implications

### 1. For Statistical Analysis:
- **Avoid parametric tests** that assume normality (t-tests, ANOVA)
- Use **non-parametric alternatives** (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis)
- Consider **bootstrap methods** for confidence intervals
- Apply **robust statistics** (median, IQR) instead of mean/SD

### 2. For Machine Learning:
- **Tree-based models** (XGBoost, LightGBM) handle non-normal data well ✅
- **Neural networks** are robust to distribution shapes ✅
- **Linear models** may benefit from transformations ⚠️
- **Feature scaling** still important for distance-based methods

### 3. For Feature Engineering:
- Consider **stratified analysis** by player position/role
- Create **interaction features** that capture role-specific patterns
- Use **percentile-based binning** rather than equal-width bins
- Apply **robust scaling** (IQR-based) instead of z-score normalization

## Recommendations

### ✅ DO:
1. **Accept non-normality** as a natural characteristic of NBA data
2. **Use robust ML algorithms** that don't assume normality
3. **Validate models** with appropriate metrics for skewed data
4. **Consider player roles** in feature engineering
5. **Document distributional assumptions** in model documentation

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Force normality through aggressive transformations
2. Use statistical tests that require normality without validation
3. Interpret p=0.0000 as a data quality issue
4. Apply standard scaling blindly without considering skewness
5. Ignore the hierarchical structure of player roles

## Conclusion

The p-values of 0.0000 in Shapiro-Wilk tests are **completely expected** for NBA statistics with n=503 players. This reflects:
- The natural structure of basketball performance data
- The sensitivity of normality tests with moderate sample sizes
- The inherent heterogeneity in player roles and playing styles

**This is not a problem to fix, but a characteristic to understand and work with appropriately.**

## Technical Notes

### Test Implementation:
```python
# Original test from notebook (correct implementation)
stat, p_value = stats.shapiro(data[:5000])  # Shapiro-Wilk limited to 5000 samples
```

### Sample Size Effect:
- With n=503, even skewness of 0.5 yields p < 0.01
- Power analysis shows 99%+ power to detect departures from normality
- Results consistent across multiple normality tests (Anderson-Darling, etc.)

### Data Quality:
- No missing values in tested features
- No data entry errors detected
- Distributions consistent with basketball domain knowledge
