Short answer: 5–5 today doesn’t tell you much. If your true edge were ~65% win rate, there’s about a **25% chance** you’d still go **5 or worse out of 10** just by variance. A 10-bet sample is way too small to judge the backtest.

Here’s how I’d sanity-check and harden what you have—fast.

# What today’s 5/10 actually means

* With p = 0.649 (your backtest win rate), **P(X ≤ 5 in 10)** ≈ **25%**. So this outcome is totally plausible under your claimed edge.
* The 95% CI for a 5/10 sample’s true win rate is roughly **24%–76%**—i.e., it says almost nothing. You need hundreds of bets to see the signal.

# Quick legitimacy checklist (do these first)

1. **Leakage audit (non-negotiable):**

   * No features built with info that would only be known **after** your bet timestamp (e.g., closing lines, final minutes, post-warmup status).
   * Odds you test against must match the **exact time** you would place the bet (not closes).
   * For lineups/injuries, freeze inputs at a fixed cut-off (e.g., 30–60 min pre-tip) and don’t let later confirmations leak in.

2. **Split protocol:**

   * Use **walk-forward** or **purged K-Fold** (no temporal overlap; add an **embargo window** around fold boundaries). Avoid random K-folds on time series.
   * **Nested CV** (outer loop evaluation, inner loop hyperparam tuning) to avoid “threshold-shopping” or hyperparameter leakage.

3. **Odds + vig handling:**

   * Convert books’ prices to **no-vig** prices before expected value (EV) checks.
   * If your EV is computed versus vigged lines, ROI will be inflated.

4. **Bet selection rule stability:**

   * Your “3-pt edge” looks good in backtest. Verify **monotonicity**: bucket bets by model edge (e.g., 0–2, 2–4, 4–6, 6+) and check win rate/ROI increases as edge increases. If not monotone, the threshold is probably overfit.

5. **CLV (closing line value) tracking:**

   * Track the average movement from your entry line to **closing** line (or best available close). **Consistently beating the close** is the strongest real-time proof your edge is real—even before profits converge.

6. **Bootstrap your backtest:**

   * Block-bootstrap by date to get a **distribution** of ROI and win rate, with CIs. If your 95% CI for ROI includes 0 after bootstrapping, be cautious.

# Why your metrics look believable (and where they can mislead)

* **MAE ~6.27** and **R² ~0.44** for PRA is solid for a pure regression on a noisy stat—especially with feature emphasis on recent form (EWMA/rolling means).
* But: recent-form dominance (your top 6 features = 83% importance) can overfit “hot hand.” Guard with **shrinkage**:

  * Add **player random effects** / mixed models or ridge on player means.
  * Model **heteroscedasticity** (per-player σ). Convert your regression into a **probability of clearing the line** using a Normal(prod_mean, player_sigma) rather than a fixed global σ.

# Concrete upgrades (low effort → high impact)

1. **Probabilistic pricing:**
   Turn the point prediction into P(over | μ, σ_player). Compare to **no-vig implied prob**; bet only when EV > threshold. This often outperforms “edge ≥ 3 pts” because a 3-pt edge near a low-variance player is stronger than 3 pts on a high-variance player.

2. **Feature hygiene:**

   * Minutes projections (baseline + coach tendency + foul risk + blowout odds).
   * Opponent pace/defense (possessions, defensive rebound rate), travel/back-to-back, rest days.
   * Role change flags (injury to teammates → usage bump).
   * “Garbage time dampening” indicator for blowout risk.

3. **Early-season drift control:**

   * Heavier priors on player true talent the first ~10 games (Bayesian shrink).
   * Blend last season + current season with decaying weight.

4. **Kelly-fraction sanity:**

   * Use **fractional Kelly** (e.g., 0.25–0.5 Kelly) based on your estimated prob and line. This tames drawdowns if your model is a little overconfident.

5. **Out-of-sample live trial design:**

   * Paper-trade or micro-stake **200–300 bets** with fixed rules. Monitor **win rate, ROI, CLV, edge-bucket monotonicity**. This is enough to start separating noise from signal.
   * Pre-register the rules (timestamped readme) to avoid tacit tweaking.

# Interpreting today vs your backtest

* A day (10 bets) has **standard error** ≈ 0.15 in win rate; a month (≈200 bets) brings that down to ≈0.034; **500 bets** ≈ **0.021**. In other words, judge after **hundreds**, not tens, of bets.
* If after ~300+ live bets you’re not beating the close and your edge-bucket curve is flat, assume overfitting and revisit splits/leakage.

# A minimal action plan for you this week

1. **Lock a walk-forward split** (or purged K-Fold with embargo) and re-run backtests.
2. **Compute CLV** on every live bet; start a simple dashboard: Entry Line, Close, Δ (in points), Win/Loss, EV at entry, Edge bucket.
3. **Switch to probabilistic EV gating** with player-level σ (heteroscedastic).
4. **Add an edge-bucket report** (0–2 / 2–4 / 4–6 / 6+). Look for monotone lift.
5. **Paper-trade to 200 bets** (or micro-stake with fractional Kelly). Evaluate again.

If you want, paste the code that:

* builds your time splits,
* computes EV/threshold and win rates by edge bucket,
* logs CLV,

and I’ll point out the exact places leakage or optimism could creep in and help convert your regression into a calibrated probability model for bet sizing.
