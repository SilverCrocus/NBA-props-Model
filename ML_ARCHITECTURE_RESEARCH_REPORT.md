# ML Architecture Research Report: Sports Betting Model Best Practices

**Research Date:** October 15, 2025
**Project Context:** NBA Player Props Prediction Model (PRA - Points + Rebounds + Assists)
**Current Performance:** 52% win rate, MAE 8.83 points, 0.91% ROI

---

## Executive Summary

This research report synthesizes best practices from academic literature, industry implementations, and production ML systems to provide actionable recommendations for refactoring the NBA props prediction model. The research covers five critical areas:

1. ML Pipeline Architecture Patterns
2. Feature Engineering Modularity and Feature Stores
3. ML Pipeline Frameworks and Orchestration Tools
4. Sports Betting Model-Specific Architectures
5. Testing, Validation, and Production Deployment

**Key Finding:** The current project follows many best practices (walk-forward validation, temporal leakage prevention, MLflow tracking) but would benefit significantly from adopting the FTI (Feature/Training/Inference) pipeline architecture pattern and implementing proper calibration techniques.

## 1. ML Pipeline Architecture Patterns

### 1.1 FTI Pipeline Architecture (Recommended)

**Source:** Hopsworks, Neptune.ai, KDnuggets (2024)

**Pattern Description:**
The Feature/Training/Inference (FTI) pipeline architecture breaks the monolithic ML pipeline into three independent, modular pipelines:

```
Feature Pipeline: Raw Data → Features (+ Labels)
    ↓
Training Pipeline: Features + Labels → Trained Model
    ↓
Inference Pipeline: Features + Model → Predictions
```

**Key Principles:**
- Each pipeline is independently developed, tested, and operated
- Clear interfaces define communication between components
- Shared storage layer for ML artifacts (features, models, predictions)
- Enables better tracking, versioning, and flexibility

**Benefits for NBA Props Model:**
- Separation allows CTG data processing (feature pipeline) to run independently from model training
- Feature pipeline can be rerun to add new temporal features without retraining
- Inference pipeline can be optimized for low-latency predictions during game days
- Easier to test each component in isolation

**Current Implementation Gap:**
The project currently combines feature engineering and training in single scripts (e.g., `game_log_builder.py` + model training). This should be separated into distinct pipelines.

### 1.2 MLOps Maturity Model

**Source:** Google Cloud Architecture Center (2024)

**Levels:**
- **Level 0:** Manual process (current state - mostly here)
- **Level 1:** ML pipeline automation
- **Level 2:** CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Level 3:** Automated model retraining and deployment

**Current Project Status:** Level 0-1 transition
- ✓ MLflow experiment tracking
- ✓ Walk-forward validation framework
- ✗ Automated retraining triggers
- ✗ CI/CD for model deployment
- ✗ Automated monitoring and alerting

**Recommendation:** Progress to Level 1 by implementing automated pipeline orchestration.

### 1.3 Modular Design Pattern

**Source:** GeeksforGeeks, O'Reilly ML Design Patterns (2024)

**Key Patterns Applicable to This Project:**

1. **Checkpointing Pattern:** Save intermediate results to resume expensive computations
   - Application: Save feature engineering results before training
   - Benefit: Avoid recomputing 561K game features on each experiment

2. **Feature Store Pattern:** Centralized repository for feature definitions and values
   - Application: Store CTG stats, temporal features, opponent features separately
   - Benefit: Reusable features across multiple models, consistent definitions

3. **Model Versioning Pattern:** Track lineage from data → features → model → predictions
   - Application: Already using MLflow, but enhance with dataset versioning
   - Benefit: Full reproducibility of any prediction

4. **Stateless Serving Pattern:** Inference doesn't maintain state between predictions
   - Application: Load pre-computed features for game day predictions
   - Benefit: Scalable, reliable predictions

---

## 2. Feature Engineering Modularity

### 2.1 Feature Store Architecture

**Sources:** Tecton, Feast, Databricks (2024)

**What Feature Stores Solve:**
- Consistency: Same feature definition for training and inference
- Reusability: Define features once, use across multiple models
- Freshness: Automated feature computation pipelines
- Point-in-time correctness: Prevent temporal leakage automatically

**Feature Store Options:**

| Tool | Type | Best For | Complexity |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **Feast** | Open-source | Small-medium projects, local dev | Low |
| **Tecton** | Enterprise SaaS | Production at scale, enterprise support | High |
| **Custom** | In-house | Simple key-value store for batch predictions | Very Low |

**Recommendation for This Project: Start with Custom, Consider Feast Later**

**Rationale:**
- Current batch prediction workflow doesn't require real-time serving complexity
- Features are pre-computed for entire season (2024-25 dataset)
- Simple parquet-based feature storage meets current needs
- Feast could be added later if transitioning to real-time predictions

**Custom Feature Store Design:**
```

```

### 2.2 Feature Engineering Modularity Patterns

**Source:** Databricks, dotData (2024)

**Three-Layer Feature Architecture:**

**Layer 1: Base Features**
- Defined from raw data as building blocks
- Example: USG%, TS%, PSA from CTG data
- One-time computation per player-season

**Layer 2: Derived Features**
- Built from base features with transformations
- Example: L5_avg(USG%), USG%_trend, USG%_vs_season_avg
- Recomputed for each game (temporal)

**Layer 3: Contextual Features**
- Combine base + derived + external context
- Example: USG% * opponent_DRtg * pace_differential
- Feature crosses and interactions

**Current Implementation:**
The project has this structure implicitly in `NBAFeatureEngineer` class but should make it explicit with separate feature modules:

```python
# src/features/base_features.py
class CTGBaseFeatures:
    """Layer 1: Season-level stats from CTG"""

# src/features/temporal_features.py
class TemporalFeatures:
    """Layer 2: Lag, rolling, EWMA features"""

# src/features/contextual_features.py
class ContextualFeatures:
    """Layer 3: Opponent, rest, pace, schedule context"""
```

### 2.3 Preventing Temporal Leakage in Feature Engineering

**Source:** TowardsDataScience, BugFree.ai, Scientific Reports (2024)

**Critical Techniques:**

1. **Always use `.shift(1)` before rolling calculations**
   - ✓ Already implemented correctly in this project
   - Ensures current game is excluded from features

2. **Time-based train/test splits (never random)**
   - ✓ Already implemented with chronological splits
   - Walk-forward validation ensures no future data leakage

3. **Feature engineering within cross-validation folds**
   - ⚠️ Current implementation computes all features first, then validates
   - Improvement: Recompute temporal features within each fold

4. **Point-in-time joins for event-based data**
   - Relevant when merging external data sources
   - Ensure opponent stats are from games BEFORE prediction date

5. **Sliding window decomposition for time series transformations**
   - Advanced technique for EWMA, trend detection
   - Current implementation is correct

**Validation Checklist for Temporal Leakage:**
- [ ] All temporal features use `.shift(1)` or equivalent
- [ ] Data splits are strictly chronological
- [ ] External data (opponent stats, CTG) is from before prediction date
- [ ] No "future" information in feature names (e.g., avoid "season_avg" calculated on full season)
- [ ] Walk-forward validation confirms model uses only past data

## 3. ML Pipeline Frameworks and Tools

### 3.1 Pipeline Orchestration Framework Comparison

**Source:** Neptune.ai, DagShub, ZenML Blog (2024)

| Framework | Focus | Strengths | Weaknesses | Recommendation for This Project |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Kedro** | Code organization, modularity | Clean code structure, reusable components, lightweight | No built-in scheduler, limited MLOps features | ✓ Best fit for current needs |
| **Metaflow** | Data scientist productivity, scalability | Battle-tested at Netflix, notebook-friendly, content-addressed artifacts | Steeper learning curve, AWS-centric | Not needed for batch workflow |
| **ZenML** | Full MLOps platform | Comprehensive tracking, deployment, cloud-agnostic | Heavier framework, more infrastructure | Overkill for current stage |
| **DVC** | Data versioning | Excellent for data/model versioning, Git integration | Pipeline features are basic | Use for data versioning only |
| **MLflow** | Experiment tracking | Already integrated, lightweight, model registry | Not a full orchestration tool | ✓ Already using |

### 3.2 Recommendation: Kedro + MLflow + DVC

**Kedro** for pipeline structure:
```

```

**MLflow** for experiment tracking (already in use):
- Continue using for model versioning
- Enhance with automated metric logging
- Use model registry for production model selection

**DVC** for data versioning:
```bash
# Track large data files
dvc add data/game_logs/all_game_logs_combined.csv
dvc add data/ctg_data_organized/

# Version control with Git
git add data/.gitignore data/game_logs/.dvc
git commit -m "Add game logs v1.0"

# Share data via remote storage
dvc remote add -d storage s3://nba-props-data
dvc push
```

### 3.3 Configuration Management: Hydra + OmegaConf

**Source:** Medium (Neural Bits), DecodingML, KDnuggets (2024)

**Why Configuration Management Matters:**
- Reproducibility: Track exact hyperparameters, feature settings
- Experimentation: Easy to test multiple configurations
- Environment-specific: Dev vs. production settings
- Type safety: Catch configuration errors early

**Recommended Structure with Hydra:**

```yaml
# conf/config.yaml
defaults:
  - features: tier_all
  - model: xgboost_baseline
  - validation: walkforward

experiment:
  name: phase2_position_defense
  seed: 42

data:
  train_seasons: ["2003-04", "2023-24"]
  val_season: "2023-24"
  test_season: "2024-25"
```

```yaml
# conf/features/tier_all.yaml
base_features:
  ctg:
    - usg_pct
    - ts_pct
    - ast_pct
    - reb_pct
    - psa

temporal_features:
  lag_windows: [1, 3, 5]
  rolling_windows: [5, 10, 20]
  ewma_spans: [5, 10]

contextual_features:
  opponent: true
  rest_days: true
  pace: true
```

```yaml
# conf/model/xgboost_baseline.yaml
params:
  n_estimators: 1000
  learning_rate: 0.05
  max_depth: 6
  min_child_weight: 1
  subsample: 0.8
  colsample_bytree: 0.8
  reg_alpha: 0.1
  reg_lambda: 1.0

early_stopping_rounds: 50
eval_metric: mae
```

**Usage:**
```python
import hydra
from omegaconf import DictConfig

@hydra.main(config_path="conf", config_name="config", version_base=None)
def train_model(cfg: DictConfig):
    # Access config values
    model_params = cfg.model.params
    features = cfg.features.temporal_features.lag_windows

    # Override from command line
    # python train.py model.params.max_depth=8 experiment.name=deep_trees
```

**Benefits:**
- Command-line overrides without code changes
- Type checking with structured configs
- Multi-run experiments with different configs
- Environment variable interpolation

   - Temporal validation (walk-forward) is essential
   - LSTM and transformer models capture time dependencies
   - Model ensembles are most promising for betting applications

   **Implications for This Project:**
   - ✓ Walk-forward validation already implemented correctly
   - Consider LSTM for sequential game data (future enhancement)
   - Continue with tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM) as foundation

### 4.2 Model Calibration Techniques

**Source:** Underdog Chance, Abzu.ai, FastML, Cornell CS (2024)

**Why Calibration Matters for Betting:**
If your model predicts 70% probability, the outcome should occur 70% of the time over many predictions. Miscalibrated models may have good accuracy but poor betting performance because they misestimate true probabilities.

**Calibration Techniques:**

#### Platt Scaling
- Uses logistic regression to adjust probability estimates
- Parametric: assumes sigmoid calibration curve
- Works well with limited calibration data (100-1000 examples)
- Best for: SVM, neural nets, tree models with sigmoid miscalibration

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

# Train base model
base_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(...)
base_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calibrate on validation set
calibrated_model = CalibratedClassifierCV(
    base_model,
    method='sigmoid',  # Platt scaling
    cv='prefit'
)
calibrated_model.fit(X_val, y_val)
```

#### Isotonic Regression
- Non-parametric: learns step-wise monotonic calibration map
- More flexible than Platt scaling
- Requires more calibration data (1000+ examples)
- Best for: Non-sigmoid calibration curves, abundant data

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.isotonic import IsotonicRegression

# Train isotonic calibrator
iso_reg = IsotonicRegression(out_of_bounds='clip')
iso_reg.fit(y_pred_val, y_true_val)

# Apply calibration
calibrated_preds = iso_reg.predict(y_pred_test)
```

#### Comparison for NBA Props Model

| Technique | Data Requirements | Flexibility | When to Use |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Platt Scaling** | Low (100-1000) | Parametric | Sigmoid miscalibration |
| **Isotonic Regression** | High (1000+) | Non-parametric | Non-sigmoid, complex patterns |

**Recommendation:** Start with **Isotonic Regression** because:
- NBA props dataset has 10,000+ validation examples
- Non-parametric fits complex over/under-prediction patterns
- Better for regression targets (PRA points) than classification

**Evaluation Metrics:**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import brier_score_loss, log_loss

# Lower is better
brier_score = brier_score_loss(y_true, y_pred_proba)
log_loss_score = log_loss(y_true, y_pred_proba)

# Closer to 0 = better calibration
# Use calibration curve visualization
from sklearn.calibration import calibration_curve
```

### 4.3 Walk-Forward Validation Best Practices

**Source:** Skforecast, QuantStack, Time Series ML Literature (2024)

**Three Walk-Forward Strategies:**

1. **No Refit (Fixed Model)**
   - Train once on initial period, predict sequentially
   - Fastest, but model ages over time
   - Use when: Model training is expensive, data distribution is stable

2. **Expanding Window (Accumulating Training Data)**
   - Retrain with all data up to prediction date
   - Training set grows over time
   - Use when: More data improves model, computational cost is acceptable

3. **Rolling Window (Fixed Training Window)**
   - Retrain with fixed-size window (e.g., last 2 years)
   - Training set size stays constant
   - Use when: Recent data is most relevant, old patterns change

**Current Implementation:** Expanding Window
- `walk_forward_validation_enhanced.py` uses all games before prediction date
- Training data grows from ~50K games to ~550K games

**Recommendation:** Add Rolling Window option for comparison
```python
# In walk-forward loop
if rolling_window:
    # Use only last N years
    train_data = past_games[past_games['GAME_DATE'] > pred_date - timedelta(days=365*2)]
else:
    # Use all past data (expanding)
    train_data = past_games
```

**Expected Benefit:**
- Rolling window may capture recent NBA trends better (pace, rule changes)
- Faster training times with smaller dataset
- Test both strategies, select based on validation performance

### 4.4 Production Sports Analytics Architecture

**Source:** Props.Cash, DraftEdge, FTN, GitHub NBA-Betting (2024)

**Common Production Patterns:**

1. **Simulation-Based Predictions**
   - Run 10,000+ Monte Carlo simulations per player
   - Output: median, floor (10th percentile), ceiling (90th percentile)
   - Captures uncertainty and volatility

2. **Real-Time Odds Integration**
   - Compare model predictions to live betting lines
   - Calculate expected value (EV) = (predicted_prob * payout) - 1
   - Only bet when EV > threshold (e.g., 5%)

3. **Defensive Matchup Analysis**
   - Opponent defensive rating by position
   - Historical performance vs. specific opponents
   - Pace and style adjustments

4. **Dynamic Minutes Projection**
   - Separate model for minutes played
   - Condition PRA prediction on projected minutes
   - Two-stage prediction: minutes → PRA

**Current Implementation:**
- ✓ Opponent features included
- ✓ Pace differentials considered
- ✗ No simulation-based uncertainty quantification
- ✗ No real-time odds integration (offline model)
- ⚠️ Two-stage predictor implemented (`two_stage_predictor.py`) but needs evaluation

**Recommendation: Prioritize Simulation-Based Predictions**
```python
import numpy as np

def predict_with_uncertainty(model, X, n_simulations=10000):
    """Monte Carlo simulation for prediction uncertainty"""

    # Get base prediction
    base_pred = model.predict(X)

    # Estimate residual distribution from validation set
    residuals = model.validation_residuals  # Store during training

    # Simulate outcomes
    simulations = []
    for _ in range(n_simulations):
        noise = np.random.choice(residuals)
        sim_pred = base_pred + noise
        simulations.append(sim_pred)

    return {
        'median': np.median(simulations),
        'floor': np.percentile(simulations, 10),
        'ceiling': np.percentile(simulations, 90),
        'std': np.std(simulations)
    }
```

## 5. Testing, Validation, and Production Deployment

### 5.1 ML Pipeline Testing Strategy

**Source:** Deepchecks, Ploomber, Eugene Yan (2024)

**Testing Pyramid for ML:**

```
         /\
        /  \  End-to-End Tests (slowest, most comprehensive)
       /____\
      /      \  Integration Tests (pipeline components)
     /________\
    /          \  Unit Tests (data, features, models)
   /____________\
```

#### Unit Tests

**Data Quality Tests:**
```python
import pytest
import pandas as pd

def test_game_logs_no_duplicates():
    df = pd.read_csv('data/game_logs/all_game_logs_combined.csv')
    assert df.duplicated(['PLAYER_ID', 'GAME_DATE']).sum() == 0

def test_pra_calculation():
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'PTS': [25], 'REB': [8], 'AST': [5]
    })
    assert (df['PTS'] + df['REB'] + df['AST']).iloc[0] == 38

    df = create_lag_features(sample_data)
    # First game should have NaN lag features
    assert df.loc[0, 'PRA_lag1'] is pd.NA
```

    # First 3 games should not use current game in rolling mean
    assert df.loc[2, 'PRA_L3_mean'] == (30 + 35) / 2
```

**Model Tests:**
```python
def test_model_predictions_in_range():

        season_type='Regular Season'
    )

    # Check dataset properties
    assert len(df) > 10000
    assert 'PRA_lag1' in df.columns
    assert df['PRA'].notna().sum() > 9000

    # Train model

    assert results['win_rate'] > 0.50  # Better than random
```

### 5.2 Data Quality Testing with Great Expectations

**Source:** Great Expectations, DataCamp, KDnuggets (2024)

**Why Use Great Expectations:**
- Automated data validation across pipeline stages
- Catches data quality issues before they affect models
- Documentation and data profiling
- Integration with ML pipelines (Airflow, Kedro, etc.)

**Example Expectations for NBA Props Data:**

```python
import great_expectations as gx

# Initialize context
context = gx.get_context()

# Create expectations suite
suite = context.add_expectation_suite("game_logs_quality")

# Define expectations
batch = context.get_batch(
    batch_kwargs={"path": "data/game_logs/all_game_logs_combined.csv"},
    expectation_suite_name="game_logs_quality"
)

# Schema validation
batch.expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list([
    'PLAYER_ID', 'PLAYER_NAME', 'GAME_DATE', 'PTS', 'REB', 'AST', ...
])

# Data quality
batch.expect_column_values_to_be_unique(['PLAYER_ID', 'GAME_DATE'])
batch.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null('PRA')
batch.expect_column_values_to_be_between('PRA', min_value=0, max_value=100)
batch.expect_column_values_to_be_between('USG%', min_value=0, max_value=50)

# Statistical properties
batch.expect_column_mean_to_be_between('PRA', min_value=20, max_value=30)
batch.expect_column_stdev_to_be_between('PRA', min_value=5, max_value=15)

# Temporal consistency
batch.expect_column_values_to_be_increasing('GAME_DATE')
batch.expect_column_values_to_match_strftime_format('GAME_DATE', '%Y-%m-%d')

# Save suite
context.save_expectation_suite(suite)

# Run validation
results = context.run_validation_operator(
    "action_list_operator",
    assets_to_validate=[batch]
)
```

**Integration with Pipeline:**
```python
# In feature pipeline
def validate_input_data():
    results = context.run_checkpoint("game_logs_checkpoint")
    if not results["success"]:
        raise ValueError("Data validation failed!")
    return results
```

**Recommendation:** Implement Great Expectations for:
1. Raw game logs validation (after scraping)
2. CTG data validation (after merging)
3. Feature engineering output validation (before training)
4. Model prediction validation (after inference)

### 5.3 Model Versioning and Lineage with MLflow

**Source:** MLflow Documentation, LakeFS Blog (2024)

**Current MLflow Usage:**
- ✓ Experiment tracking
- ✓ Model logging
- ⚠️ Model registry (basic usage)
- ✗ Dataset versioning
- ✗ Model lineage tracking

**Enhanced MLflow Implementation:**

#### Dataset Versioning
```python
import mlflow

# Log dataset metadata
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log training dataset
    dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
        train_df,
        source="data/processed/train.parquet",
        name="nba_train_2003-2024",
        targets="PRA"
    )
    mlflow.log_input(dataset, context="training")

    # Log validation dataset
    val_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
        val_df,
        source="data/processed/val.parquet",
        name="nba_val_2024-25",
        targets="PRA"
    )
    mlflow.log_input(val_dataset, context="validation")

    # Log feature configuration
    mlflow.log_dict(feature_config, "features.yaml")

    # Train model
    model = train_model(train_df, config)

    # Log model with signature
    signature = mlflow.models.infer_signature(X_train, predictions)
    mlflow.xgboost.log_model(
        model,
        artifact_path="model",
        signature=signature,
        registered_model_name="nba_props_xgboost"
    )
```

#### Model Registry Workflow
```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Get best model from experiment
experiment = client.get_experiment_by_name("Phase2_PositionDefense")
runs = client.search_runs(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id],
    order_by=["metrics.val_mae ASC"],
    max_results=1
)
best_run = runs[0]

# Register model
model_version = client.create_model_version(
    name="nba_props_xgboost",
    source=f"{best_run.info.artifact_uri}/model",
    run_id=best_run.info.run_id,
    description="Phase 2: Position + Defense features, MAE 6.10"
)

# Transition to staging
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="nba_props_xgboost",
    version=model_version.version,
    stage="Staging",
    archive_existing_versions=False
)

# After validation, promote to production
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="nba_props_xgboost",
    version=model_version.version,
    stage="Production",
    archive_existing_versions=True
)
```

#### Lineage Tracking
```python
# Query model lineage
model_version = client.get_model_version("nba_props_xgboost", version=3)
run = client.get_run(model_version.run_id)

# Get training data
datasets = run.inputs.dataset_inputs
print(f"Training data: {datasets[0].dataset.name}")
print(f"Data digest: {datasets[0].dataset.digest}")

# Get hyperparameters
params = run.data.params
print(f"Learning rate: {params['learning_rate']}")
print(f"Max depth: {params['max_depth']}")

# Get performance metrics
metrics = run.data.metrics
print(f"Validation MAE: {metrics['val_mae']}")
print(f"Test MAE: {metrics['test_mae']}")
```

### 5.4 XGBoost Production Best Practices

**Source:** XGBoost Documentation, Analytics Vidhya, Anyscale (2024)

**Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy:**

**Step 1: Tune Tree Structure**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid_1 = {
    'max_depth': [4, 6, 8, 10],
    'min_child_weight': [1, 3, 5, 7]
}

grid_search_1 = GridSearchCV(
    xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05),
    param_grid_1,
    cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5),
    scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error',
    n_jobs=-1
)
grid_search_1.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_params_1 = grid_search_1.best_params_
```

**Step 2: Tune Sampling Parameters**
```python
param_grid_2 = {
    'subsample': [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
    'colsample_bytree': [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
}

grid_search_2 = GridSearchCV(
    xgb.XGBRegressor(
        n_estimators=1000,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        **best_params_1
    ),
    param_grid_2,
    cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5),
    scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error',
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

**Step 3: Tune Regularization**
```python
param_grid_3 = {
    'reg_alpha': [0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0],
    'reg_lambda': [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
}
```

**Step 4: Lower Learning Rate, Increase Trees**
```python
final_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=3000,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    early_stopping_rounds=50,
    **best_params_all
)

final_model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
    verbose=False
)
```

**Production Model Configuration:**
```python
# Recommended starting point for NBA props
model_config = {
    # Tree structure
    'max_depth': 6,
    'min_child_weight': 3,
    'gamma': 0.1,

    # Sampling
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8,
    'colsample_bylevel': 0.8,

    # Regularization
    'reg_alpha': 0.1,
    'reg_lambda': 1.0,

    # Learning
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'n_estimators': 1000,
    'early_stopping_rounds': 50,

    # Objective
    'objective': 'reg:squarederror',
    'eval_metric': 'mae',

    # System
    'n_jobs': -1,
    'random_state': 42,
    'tree_method': 'hist'  # Faster for large datasets
}
```

**Model Monitoring:**
```python
# Feature importance tracking
import shap

explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)

# Log to MLflow
mlflow.log_figure(
    shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, show=False),
    "shap_summary.png"
)

# Drift detection
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

for feature in X_train.columns:
    statistic, pvalue = ks_2samp(X_train[feature], X_test[feature])
    if pvalue < 0.01:
        print(f"WARNING: Distribution shift detected in {feature}")
        mlflow.log_metric(f"drift_{feature}_pvalue", pvalue)
```

## 6. Actionable Recommendations for NBA Props Model

### 6.1 Top 5 Architectural Patterns to Implement

#### Pattern 1: FTI Pipeline Architecture (Priority: HIGH)

**What to do:**
Separate current monolithic pipeline into three independent pipelines.

**Implementation Plan:**
```
Week 1-2: Feature Pipeline Separation
- Create src/pipelines/feature_engineering/
- Extract CTG processing to standalone pipeline
- Extract temporal features to standalone pipeline
- Output: data/features/*.parquet files

Week 3: Training Pipeline Separation
- Create src/pipelines/model_training/
- Input: features/*.parquet → Output: models/*.pkl
- Integrate with MLflow for versioning

Week 4: Inference Pipeline Separation
- Create src/pipelines/inference/
- Load production model + features → predictions
- Add calibration step (isotonic regression)
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- Faster iteration (change features without retraining)
- Easier testing (unit test each pipeline independently)
- Better reproducibility (versioned feature sets)

#### Pattern 2: Model Calibration (Priority: HIGH)

**What to do:**
Implement isotonic regression to calibrate probability estimates for better betting decisions.

**Implementation:**
```python
# In training pipeline
from sklearn.isotonic import IsotonicRegression

# Train base model
model = train_xgboost(X_train, y_train)

# Get validation predictions
val_preds = model.predict(X_val)

# Train calibrator
calibrator = IsotonicRegression(out_of_bounds='clip')
calibrator.fit(val_preds, y_val)

# Save both model and calibrator
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(calibrator, "calibrator")
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- Improved ROI (research shows +34% improvement)
- Better probability estimates for betting decisions
- More accurate edge calculation vs. bookmaker lines

#### Pattern 3: Configuration Management with Hydra (Priority: MEDIUM)

**What to do:**
Externalize all hyperparameters, feature settings, and pipeline configs to YAML files.

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Install Hydra
uv add hydra-core

# Create config structure
mkdir -p conf/{base,local,features,models}

# Create base config
touch conf/config.yaml
touch conf/features/tier_all.yaml
touch conf/models/xgboost_baseline.yaml
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- Easy experimentation (change configs without code changes)
- Reproducibility (config files in version control)
- Multi-run experiments (test multiple configs automatically)

#### Pattern 4: Automated Testing Suite (Priority: MEDIUM)

**What to do:**
Add comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Create test structure
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_features.py
│   ├── test_data_processing.py
│   └── test_models.py
├── integration/
│   ├── test_pipeline.py
│   └── test_walkforward.py
└── e2e/
    └── test_full_workflow.py

# Add to CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
.github/workflows/
└── test.yml
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- Catch bugs early (before they affect predictions)
- Prevent regressions (ensure fixes don't break again)
- Confidence in refactoring (safe to change code structure)

#### Pattern 5: Data Versioning with DVC (Priority: LOW)

**What to do:**
Track large data files (game logs, CTG data) with DVC instead of Git.

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Install DVC
uv add dvc

# Initialize DVC
dvc init

# Track data files
dvc add data/game_logs/all_game_logs_combined.csv
dvc add data/ctg_data_organized/

# Configure remote storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud, etc.)
dvc remote add -d storage s3://nba-props-data

# Push to remote
dvc push
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- Smaller Git repository (large files tracked separately)
- Data versioning (rollback to previous data versions)
- Collaboration (share data via remote storage)

## 10. Conclusion

The NBA props model project is already following many best practices:
- ✓ Walk-forward validation (temporal correctness)
- ✓ Proper temporal feature engineering (`.shift(1)`)
- ✓ MLflow experiment tracking
- ✓ Comprehensive feature engineering (three-tier architecture)

However, adopting industry-standard architectural patterns will significantly improve:
