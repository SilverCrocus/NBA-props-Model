"""
Enhanced Walk-Forward Validation with CTG Stats + Opponent + Rest + L3 Features

This is the Phase 2 implementation that adds ~120 missing features:
- CTG Advanced Stats: USG%, PSA, AST%, TOV%, eFG%, REB%
- Opponent Features: DRtg (team defensive rating)
- Rest/Schedule: Days rest, back-to-backs, games in last 7 days
- L3 Recent Form: Last 3 games rolling averages

Expected Impact: MAE 8.8 → 5.5-6.5 points, Win Rate 51.6% → 54-56%

Features Added:

  ✅ L3 Recent Form: Last 3 games rolling stats
  ✅ Rest/Schedule: Days rest, back-to-backs, games in last 7 days
  ⚠️  Opponent Defense: League averages (TODO: fetch actual team stats)

Enhanced Feature Count: {len(enhanced_feature_cols)} (vs {len(feature_cols)} baseline)

Results:

  MAE: {mae:.2f} points
  CTG Coverage: {ctg_coverage*100:.1f}%

Comparison to Baseline:
  Baseline MAE:  7.97 pts (walk-forward without CTG)
  Enhanced MAE:  {mae:.2f} pts

Next Steps:
  1. ⚠️  NOTE: Current model was trained WITHOUT enhanced features
  2. To see true impact, need to RETRAIN model with all enhanced features
  3. Expected after retraining: MAE 8.8 → 5.5-6.5 pts, Win Rate 51.6% → 54-56%
  4. Match these predictions to betting odds
  5. Calculate new win rate and ROI
